# Week 29: Sales Processes & Methodologies

**Semester 3: Marketing, Go-to-Market & Growth**
**Week 29 of 52 • Estimated Time: 15-20 hours**

---

## Overview

You've built a demand generation engine that fills your pipeline with qualified leads. But pipeline isn't revenue—deals don't close themselves. This week, you'll learn how to build a repeatable sales process that systematically converts qualified leads into paying customers.

Sales isn't about charisma or "natural talent." It's about having a proven process, asking the right questions, understanding buyer psychology, and knowing exactly what to do at each stage of the deal. The best salespeople aren't the smoothest talkers—they're the most disciplined executors of a well-designed system.

This week covers:
- Designing a repeatable sales process from first touch to closed-won
- Proven sales methodologies (MEDDIC, BANT, Challenger Sale, Sandler)
- Discovery call frameworks that uncover real needs
- Demo strategies that drive urgency
- Objection handling and negotiation tactics
- Forecasting revenue accurately
- Building a sales playbook that scales

By the end of this week, you'll understand how to close your first 10 customers without a sales team, and how to build the foundation for a scalable sales organization.

## Why Sales Process Matters

**The Problem with "Winging It"**

Most technical founders hate sales. They approach it like this:
1. Someone requests a demo
2. They show the product for 30 minutes
3. They say "So... what do you think?"
4. Prospect says "Interesting, let me think about it"
5. Deal dies

Why? No process. No qualification. No urgency. No close.

**Sales Process = Revenue Predictability**

A great sales process creates predictability:
- **Pipeline Coverage**: You know you need 3× pipeline to hit quota
- **Conversion Rates**: You know 30% of demos → trials, 20% of trials → paid
- **Sales Cycle**: You know the average deal takes 14 days from demo to close
- **Revenue Forecast**: You can predict Q3 revenue in Q1 based on pipeline

This lets you answer critical questions:
- "Will we hit our $500K ARR goal this year?" → Look at pipeline × conversion rate
- "Do we need to hire another salesperson?" → Look at pipeline growth vs capacity
- "Should we invest more in demand gen?" → Look at cost per SQL vs LTV

**Key Metrics**

Sales efficiency is measured by:
- **Win Rate**: % of opportunities that close (target: 20-30% for new SaaS)
- **Sales Cycle Length**: Days from SQL to closed-won (target: 14-30 days for SMB, 60-90 for mid-market)
- **Average Deal Size**: Typical contract value (track over time, should increase)
- **Pipeline Coverage**: Pipeline value / quota (target: 3-4×)
- **Sales Efficiency**: CAC payback period (target: <12 months)

## Part 1: The Sales Process Framework

**What is a Sales Process?**

A sales process is a sequence of repeatable steps that move a prospect from awareness to purchase.

**Bad sales process**:
```
Lead comes in → Someone calls them → Maybe demo → Hope they buy
```

**Good sales process**:
```
SQL → Qualification Call → Discovery Call → Demo → Trial → Check-in →
Negotiation → Closed-Won
```

Each stage has:
1. **Entry criteria**: What must be true to enter this stage
2. **Activities**: What the salesperson does
3. **Exit criteria**: What must happen to move to next stage
4. **Expected conversion rate**: % that move to next stage
5. **Expected duration**: How long prospects stay in this stage

**Example: Bibby Sales Process (7 Stages)**

Let's design a complete sales process for Bibby's $100/year plan:

---

### Stage 1: SQL (Sales Qualified Lead)

**Entry Criteria**:
- MQL from marketing (score ≥ 60)
- Matches ICP (developer, knowledge worker, researcher)
- Shown intent (pricing page, demo request, trial signup)

**Activities**:
- Sales rep reviews lead score and behavior
- Researches prospect (LinkedIn, company website)
- Sends personalized outreach email within 1 hour

**Exit Criteria**:
- Prospect responds to outreach
- Qualification call scheduled

**Conversion Rate**: 40% (40% of SQLs book a call)
**Duration**: 1-3 days

---

### Stage 2: Qualification Call (15 minutes)

**Entry Criteria**:
- Call scheduled
- Rep has done basic research

**Activities**:
- Quick intro (2 min)
- Ask qualification questions (BANT framework - 8 min)
  - **Budget**: "What's your budget for productivity tools?"
  - **Authority**: "Who else is involved in this decision?"
  - **Need**: "What problem are you trying to solve?"
  - **Timeline**: "When do you need a solution?"
- Determine fit (3 min)
- If qualified: Schedule discovery/demo (2 min)
- If not qualified: Politely decline and send to nurture

**Exit Criteria**:
- Qualified AND discovery call scheduled
- OR disqualified and moved to nurture

**Conversion Rate**: 60% (60% qualify and move forward)
**Duration**: 15 minutes

---

### Stage 3: Discovery Call + Demo (45 minutes)

**Entry Criteria**:
- Qualified via BANT
- Prospect has clear need

**Activities**:
- Discovery (15 min) - Deep dive on their workflow, pain points, current solution
- Demo (20 min) - Show product focused on THEIR use case
- Handle objections (5 min)
- Set clear next steps (5 min): "Start trial today, I'll check in on Day 3"

**Exit Criteria**:
- Trial started
- Next check-in scheduled

**Conversion Rate**: 50% (50% start trial)
**Duration**: 45 minutes

---

### Stage 4: Trial (14 days)

**Entry Criteria**:
- Trial account created
- Initial check-in scheduled

**Activities**:
- Day 1: Send onboarding email with quick-start guide
- Day 3: Check-in call (15 min) - "How's it going? Any questions?"
- Day 7: Value reinforcement email - "3 tips to get more from Bibby"
- Day 10: Check-in call (15 min) - "Ready to upgrade?"
- Day 13: Urgency email - "Trial ending tomorrow - let's get you set up"

**Exit Criteria**:
- Prospect is actively using product (logged in 3+ times, added data)
- Ready to discuss pricing

**Conversion Rate**: 30% (30% of trials convert to paid)
**Duration**: 14 days

---

### Stage 5: Proposal/Negotiation (2-5 days)

**Entry Criteria**:
- Trial user is engaged
- Clear intent to purchase

**Activities**:
- Send proposal (pricing options, payment terms)
- Handle pricing objections
- Offer limited-time incentive if needed ("20% off if you sign by Friday")
- Get verbal commitment

**Exit Criteria**:
- Prospect agrees to pricing
- Ready to sign

**Conversion Rate**: 80% (most who reach this stage close)
**Duration**: 2-5 days

---

### Stage 6: Contract/Closed-Won (1-2 days)

**Entry Criteria**:
- Verbal commitment secured
- Pricing agreed

**Activities**:
- Send contract or payment link
- Follow up if not signed within 24 hours
- Process payment
- Send welcome/onboarding email

**Exit Criteria**:
- Contract signed and payment received
- Customer onboarded

**Conversion Rate**: 95% (verbal commitment → closed)
**Duration**: 1-2 days

---

### Stage 7: Onboarding (30 days)

**Entry Criteria**:
- Paid customer

**Activities**:
- Week 1: Onboarding call, setup assistance
- Week 2: Check-in, advanced features
- Week 3: Usage review, answer questions
- Week 4: Success check, ask for referrals/testimonial

**Exit Criteria**:
- Customer is activated (using product regularly)
- Renewal likelihood is high

**Conversion Rate**: N/A (goal is retention)
**Duration**: 30 days

---

**Overall Funnel Math**

Starting with 100 SQLs:
```
100 SQLs
  → 40 Qualification Calls (40% conversion)
  → 24 Discovery/Demos (60% conversion)
  → 12 Trials (50% conversion)
  → 4 Negotiations (30% conversion)
  → 3 Closed-Won (80% × 95% = 76% conversion)
```

**Overall SQL → Customer**: 3% win rate

This is actually low for a $100/year product. Most self-serve SaaS should be 10-15%. The bottleneck is the 30% trial → paid conversion. This is where you'd focus optimization.

## Part 2: Sales Methodologies

A sales methodology is a framework for how to sell. Think of it as the philosophy behind your process.

### Methodology 1: BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)

**Origin**: IBM in the 1950s (oldest and simplest)

**Framework**:
- **Budget**: Do they have money allocated?
- **Authority**: Can they make the purchase decision?
- **Need**: Do they have a problem you solve?
- **Timeline**: When do they need a solution?

**When to Use**: Quick qualification for transactional sales (<$5K deals)

**Example Questions for Bibby**:
- **Budget**: "What's your current budget for productivity tools?" or "Are you currently paying for Notion/Evernote?"
- **Authority**: "Is this just for you, or are you evaluating for your team?" "Who else needs to approve this?"
- **Need**: "What's the biggest challenge with your current reading/note system?"
- **Timeline**: "When do you need this solved by? Is there a trigger event (new job, new project)?"

**Disqualification Criteria**:
- Budget: "I'm not paying for anything" → Disqualify (or offer free tier if available)
- Authority: "I need to run this by my boss/team" → Note the decision process
- Need: "No real problem, just browsing" → Disqualify, add to nurture
- Timeline: "Maybe someday" → Disqualify, add to nurture

---

### Methodology 2: MEDDIC (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion)

**Origin**: PTC (enterprise software), 1990s

**Framework**:
- **Metrics**: What measurable impact will your solution have?
- **Economic Buyer**: Who controls the budget?
- **Decision Criteria**: What criteria are they using to evaluate solutions?
- **Decision Process**: What's the approval process?
- **Identify Pain**: What problem are they trying to solve?
- **Champion**: Who internally is advocating for your solution?

**When to Use**: Complex, multi-stakeholder deals (>$10K, enterprise)

**Example for Bibby** (if selling to a company for 50 engineers):

- **Metrics**: "If each engineer saves 2 hours/month finding information they've already learned, that's 100 hours/month saved = $10K/month value"
- **Economic Buyer**: "Who approves software purchases for the engineering team?" (CTO, VP Eng, Procurement)
- **Decision Criteria**: "What are you looking for in a knowledge management tool?" (CLI, privacy, integration, price)
- **Decision Process**: "Walk me through how a tool like this gets approved" (Pilot with 5 users → feedback → budget approval → rollout)
- **Identify Pain**: "Engineers are re-reading the same books, Googling the same concepts, losing insights"
- **Champion**: Engineering manager who loves the product and will advocate internally

**Why MEDDIC Works**: It forces you to understand the entire buying organization, not just one user.

### Methodology 3: Challenger Sale (Teach, Tailor, Take Control)

**Origin**: CEB (now Gartner), 2011 book "The Challenger Sale"

**Framework**:
1. **Teach**: Bring insights the customer doesn't know
2. **Tailor**: Customize message to their situation
3. **Take Control**: Push back, create urgency, lead the sale

**Philosophy**: Don't just respond to customer needs—teach them something new about their business and challenge their thinking.

**Example for Bibby**:

**Teach** (Insight they don't know):
```
"Most people think reading more books makes them smarter. But research shows
retention rate is only 10-20% for most readers. That means if you read 30 books
last year, you retained insights from maybe 3-6.

The problem isn't reading—it's retrieval. Your brain needs a system to surface
the right knowledge at the right time. That's what Bibby does."
```

**Tailor** (Specific to their role):
```
"As an engineering manager, you're probably reading books on leadership,
1:1s, feedback, hiring. But when you're in the moment—preparing for a tough
conversation—can you instantly recall 'that framework from Radical Candor'?

With Bibby, you'd search 'difficult conversation framework' and get your notes
from 3 different books in 2 seconds. That's the difference between theory and
applied knowledge."
```

**Take Control** (Push back, create urgency):
```
Prospect: "I'm not sure I need a tool for this. I can just use Notion."

Rep: "You *could* use Notion. But here's the question: Have you actually been
using Notion to search your book notes? Most people set it up with good
intentions, then never look at it again because the friction is too high.

Bibby works because it's a CLI—it's as fast as your terminal. If it takes
10 seconds to open Notion and navigate, you won't do it. If it takes 1 second
in your terminal, you will.

The question isn't whether you *can* use Notion. It's whether you *will*.
And the data says: probably not."
```

**When to Use**: When you have a strong POV and the prospect needs education, not just a demo.

---

### Methodology 4: Sandler Selling System (Pain, Budget, Decision)

**Origin**: David Sandler, 1960s

**Framework**:
- **Pain**: Uncover emotional pain (not just logical problems)
- **Budget**: Discuss money upfront (no surprises)
- **Decision**: Get clear agreement on next steps

**Philosophy**: Reverse the traditional sales dynamic. Make the prospect "sell you" on why they're a good fit.

**Example Questions for Bibby**:

**Pain** (Go deep on emotional impact):
```
"Walk me through the last time you needed to recall something from a book
you'd read. What happened?"

[Prospect: "I was writing a proposal and remembered a great framework from a
book, but I couldn't remember which book or the details. I spent 20 minutes
Googling and gave up."]

"How did that feel?"

[Prospect: "Frustrating. I knew I'd learned it, but couldn't access it."]

"Has this happened before?"

[Prospect: "All the time."]

"What's the cost of this—not just in time, but in confidence and credibility?"

[Prospect: "Good question. I probably lose 2-3 hours a week searching for
things I've already learned. And it makes me feel like my reading is pointless."]
```

Notice: You're making them articulate the pain, not telling them they have it.

**Budget** (Get to money early):
```
"If we find that Bibby solves this problem, is $100/year something you'd
be comfortable investing?"

[If yes → Continue]
[If hesitation → "What would make it worth $100/year for you?"]
[If no → "What budget do you have in mind?" or disqualify]
```

**Decision** (Get commitment on next steps):
```
"Let's say you try Bibby for 14 days and it works great—you're finding insights
instantly, it becomes part of your workflow. What would stop you from becoming
a paying customer?"

[Prospect reveals objections upfront: "I'd need to import my Goodreads library"
or "I'd want my team to use it too"]

"Great, let's make sure we test both of those during the trial."
```

**When to Use**: When you want to qualify hard and avoid wasting time on tire-kickers.

## Part 3: Discovery Call Framework

Discovery is the most important part of the sales process. A great demo without discovery is just a feature tour. A great demo *after* discovery is a solution presentation.

**Discovery Goals**:
1. Understand their current situation (baseline)
2. Uncover their desired future state (goal)
3. Identify the gap (problem/pain)
4. Quantify the cost of inaction (urgency)
5. Understand their decision process (how they buy)

**The SPIN Framework** (Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-Payoff)

**Origin**: Neil Rackham, 1988 book "SPIN Selling"

### 1. Situation Questions (Understand current state)

Goal: Get context without interrogating

```
"Tell me about your current reading system. How do you track books?
How do you take notes? Where do you store them?"

"Walk me through your workflow: You finish a book, then what?"

"What tools are you using today? Goodreads? Notion? Pen and paper?"
```

**Rookie mistake**: Asking 20 situation questions. Keep it to 3-5, then move on.

### 2. Problem Questions (Uncover pain)

Goal: Identify specific problems with their current approach

```
"What's frustrating about your current system?"

"Have you ever needed to recall something from a book but couldn't find it?"

"How often do you read a book, get excited about an idea, then completely
forget it a month later?"

"Do you feel like your reading is actually making you smarter, or are you
just consuming content?"
```

**Listen for**: Emotional words (frustrating, annoying, waste of time)

### 3. Implication Questions (Amplify the pain)

Goal: Make them realize the cost is higher than they thought

```
"How much time per week do you spend re-searching for things you've already
learned?"

[Prospect: "Probably 2-3 hours."]

"So that's 10-12 hours per month. If your time is worth $100/hour, that's
$1,200/month in lost productivity. Over a year, that's $14,000."

[Let that sink in]

"And that's just the time cost. What about the opportunity cost—the insights
you've forgotten that could have helped you make better decisions?"
```

**Why this works**: You're quantifying a "soft" problem into hard dollars.

### 4. Need-Payoff Questions (Paint the future)

Goal: Get them to articulate the value of solving the problem

```
"If you had a system where you could instantly search everything you've ever
learned from books, how would that change your work?"

[Prospect: "I'd feel way more confident in meetings. I could cite specific
frameworks instead of vaguely remembering 'something from a book.'"]

"What would that be worth to you?"

[Prospect: "Honestly, it'd be huge. I read to get better at my job, but if I
can't apply it, what's the point?"]

"So if Bibby solved this—gave you instant recall of everything you've read—
would $100/year be a reasonable investment?"

[Prospect: "Yeah, absolutely."]
```

**Notice**: THEY sold themselves. You just asked questions.

**Discovery Call Script for Bibby** (15-minute version)

```
[00:00-02:00] INTRO
"Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. I've got 15 minutes blocked—does that
still work?"

[Get agreement]

"Great. Quick context: I saw you downloaded our PKM guide and visited the
pricing page, so I know you're thinking about knowledge management. My goal
today is to understand your situation, see if Bibby is a fit, and if so,
get you set up on a trial. Sound good?"

[00:02-00:06] SITUATION
"Tell me about your reading habits. How many books do you read per year?"

"How do you currently track what you've read and take notes?"

"What made you start looking for a solution like Bibby?"

[00:06-00:10] PROBLEM + IMPLICATION
"What's the biggest frustration with your current system?"

[Listen, then dig deeper]

"How often does that happen?"

"What's the cost—in time, in frustration, in missed opportunities?"

[00:10-00:13] NEED-PAYOFF
"If you had instant access to everything you've ever learned from books,
how would that change things?"

"What would that be worth to you?"

[00:13-00:15] NEXT STEPS
"Based on what you've shared, I think Bibby could be a great fit. Here's
what I'd suggest:

1. Start a 14-day free trial today
2. I'll send you our quick-start guide (5-minute setup)
3. Let's schedule a check-in call for Day 3 to make sure you're getting value

Sound good?"

[Get commitment, send trial link, schedule follow-up]
```

## Part 4: Demo Strategy

**The Golden Rule: Demo What They Need, Not Everything You Have**

Bad demo:
- 30 minutes walking through every feature
- "And here you can configure X, and here's the settings for Y..."
- Prospect is bored, confused, overwhelmed

Good demo:
- 10-15 minutes showing how it solves THEIR problem
- Use their language, their use case
- Create "aha moments"

**Demo Structure** (15-20 minutes)

### 1. Recap Discovery (2 min)

```
"Before I show you anything, let me recap what I heard:

- You read 30-40 books/year, mostly on leadership and product management
- You take notes in Notion but rarely look at them again
- Last week you needed a framework on OKRs but couldn't find your notes
- You want instant access to your insights when you need them

Did I get that right?"

[Confirm, adjust as needed]

"Great. I'm going to show you exactly how Bibby solves this."
```

**Why this works**: It proves you listened, and it sets up the demo to be relevant.

### 2. The "Before" Picture (2 min)

```
"This is what most people do:

[Screenshare Notion with nested pages, folders, tags]

You read a book, add notes here... it's organized... but when you need to
find 'that OKR framework,' you have to remember: Was it in the 'Leadership'
folder? The 'Product' folder? Was it from 'Measure What Matters' or 'Radical
Focus'?

So you search Notion... but Notion search is slow and doesn't understand
context. You give up and Google it.

Sound familiar?"
```

### 3. The "After" Picture (10 min)

```
"Here's Bibby:

[Show terminal]

You want the OKR framework you read about?

$ bibby search 'OKR framework'

[Results appear instantly with excerpts from 2 different books]

Here's your note from 'Measure What Matters' on Google's OKR framework.
And here's one from 'Radical Focus' on startup OKRs.

2 seconds. No folder navigation. No trying to remember which book.

Now let me show you how it works under the hood...

[Quick walkthrough: adding a book, adding a note, searching, tagging]

See how fast that was? That's because Bibby is a CLI—it's native to how
developers work. No opening a browser, no clicking through pages.

One more thing: Let's say you want to see all your notes on a theme...

$ bibby notes --tag leadership

[Shows all leadership notes across all books]

You're basically building a personal Wikipedia of everything you've learned."
```

### 4. Objection Handling (3 min)

```
"What questions do you have?"

[Handle 2-3 objections—covered in next section]
```

### 5. Next Steps (2 min)

```
"Want to try it?"

[Get yes]

"Great. Here's the link to start your trial. I'll send you the quick-start
guide. And let's schedule a check-in for Day 3—I'll make sure you're set up
and answer any questions.

When works for you—Tuesday at 2pm or Wednesday at 10am?"

[Schedule, send link, confirm]
```

**Demo Best Practices**

1. **Keep it short**: 15 minutes max. Longer demos lose attention.
2. **Use their data**: If possible, have them import their actual books during the demo.
3. **Create "wow" moments**: The instant search result is a wow moment. Plan for 2-3 per demo.
4. **Minimize clicks**: Every click is friction. CLI demos should be fast.
5. **Pause for questions**: Don't monologue for 15 minutes straight.

## Part 5: Objection Handling

Objections aren't rejection—they're requests for more information. The best salespeople LOVE objections because they reveal what's blocking the sale.

**The Framework: LAER (Listen, Acknowledge, Explore, Respond)**

### Objection 1: "I'm not sure I need this"

**Listen**: "Tell me more about that."

**Acknowledge**: "I get it—adding a new tool always has a cost."

**Explore**: "When you say you're not sure you need it, is it that you don't have the problem? Or you're not sure Bibby solves it?"

**Respond** (tailor based on their answer):
- If they don't have the problem: "Fair enough. Out of curiosity, how do you currently recall things from books you've read?" [Re-discover pain]
- If they're not sure Bibby solves it: "What would you need to see during the trial to feel confident it works?"

### Objection 2: "It's too expensive"

**Listen**: "What's too expensive about it?"

**Acknowledge**: "I understand—$100/year is real money."

**Explore**: "How are you thinking about the value? Compared to what?"

**Respond**:
```
"Let's break it down:

$100/year = $8/month = $0.27/day

You read, what, 30 books/year? If each book costs $15, you're spending $450/year
on books.

If Bibby helps you retain and apply even 10% more of what you read, that's
$45 in additional value from your book investment. Plus the time savings from
instant search.

How much time do you spend per week searching for things you've already
learned—notes, frameworks, ideas?"

[Prospect: "Maybe an hour or two."]

"If your time is worth $50/hour, that's $100/week = $5,000/year. If Bibby
saves you 10% of that time, it pays for itself in 2 weeks.

Does that reframe the investment?"
```

### Objection 3: "I'll just use Notion / Obsidian / Evernote"

**Listen**: "Are you currently using [tool] for this?"

**Acknowledge**: "Those are great tools—lots of people use them."

**Explore**: "What's working well with [tool]? And what's not?"

**Respond**:
```
"Here's the difference:

Notion / Obsidian / Evernote are general-purpose note-taking tools. They can
do *anything*, which means they require setup and maintenance.

Bibby is purpose-built for one thing: Book knowledge management. You don't
have to design a system—the system is the product.

Plus, Bibby is a CLI. If you're a developer, you live in the terminal. Opening
a browser and navigating Notion adds 10-15 seconds of friction. That's enough
to not do it.

Bibby: 1 second. `bibby search 'topic'`. Done.

You can still use Notion for other things. But for book knowledge, Bibby is
faster and simpler.

Want to compare them side-by-side during your trial?"
```

### Objection 4: "I need to think about it"

**This is the most common (and most dangerous) objection.**

**Listen**: "Absolutely—what specifically do you need to think about?"

**Acknowledge**: "Totally fair. This is a decision worth thinking through."

**Explore**: "Is there something I didn't cover that you need more information on? Or is it more about timing?"

**Respond** (based on what they say):
- **If it's timing**: "When were you hoping to have a solution in place?"
- **If it's information**: "What questions can I answer right now?"
- **If it's vague**: "Let me ask this: If everything we discussed today is accurate—Bibby solves your problem, the trial is free, and it's $100/year—is there any reason you wouldn't at least try it?" [Uncover the REAL objection]

**The Close**:
```
"How about this: Start the trial today (it's free, no credit card). Use it for
a week. If it doesn't click, no hard feelings. But if it does, you'll have
your answer and you'll be set up.

Fair?"
```

## Part 6: Forecasting Revenue

Sales forecasting predicts future revenue based on current pipeline. It's critical for planning hiring, spend, and growth.

**Forecast Types**

1. **Commit**: Revenue you're highly confident will close (90%+ probability)
2. **Best Case**: Commit + likely deals (70%+ probability)
3. **Pipeline**: All open opportunities (weighted by stage)

**Weighted Pipeline Forecast**

Each stage has a probability of closing:

```
Stage                Probability
SQL                  5%
Qualification        10%
Discovery/Demo       20%
Trial                40%
Negotiation          75%
Contract             95%
```

**Example**:

You have:
- 50 SQLs × $100 each = $5,000 pipeline × 5% = $250 weighted
- 20 Qualification × $100 = $2,000 × 10% = $200 weighted
- 10 Discovery × $100 = $1,000 × 20% = $200 weighted
- 8 Trials × $100 = $800 × 40% = $320 weighted
- 3 Negotiation × $100 = $300 × 75% = $225 weighted
- 2 Contract × $100 = $200 × 95% = $190 weighted

**Total Weighted Pipeline**: $1,385

This is your expected revenue from current pipeline.

**Implementation**

```java
@Service
public class SalesForecastService {

    public record StageForecast(
        Stage stage,
        int dealCount,
        double totalValue,

        double bestCase,         // 70%+ probability
        double pipeline,         // All deals, weighted
        List<StageForecast> byStage
    ) {}

    public Forecast generateForecast(List<SalesProcessService.Deal> deals, String period) {

        Map<SalesProcessService.Stage, List<SalesProcessService.Deal>> byStage =
            deals.stream()
                .filter(d -> d.status() == SalesProcessService.DealStatus.OPEN)
                .collect(groupingBy(SalesProcessService.Deal::currentStage));

        // Calculate forecast for each stage
        List<StageForecast> stageForecasts = new ArrayList<>();
        double totalWeighted = 0;

        for (SalesProcessService.Stage stage : SalesProcessService.Stage.values()) {
            List<SalesProcessService.Deal> stageDeals =
                byStage.getOrDefault(stage, List.of());

            int count = stageDeals.size();
            double totalValue = stageDeals.stream()
                .mapToDouble(SalesProcessService.Deal::dealValue)
                .sum();

            double probability = getStageProbability(stage);
            double weightedValue = totalValue * probability;

            stageForecasts.add(new StageForecast(stage, count, totalValue, weightedValue));
            totalWeighted += weightedValue;
        }

**Stretch Goal**: Role-play a discovery call with a friend or colleague. Record it and analyze your performance.

---

## Reflection Questions

1. **Process vs Intuition**: How much should sales be scripted vs improvised? Where's the balance between following a process and reading the room?

2. **Qualification Rigor**: Is it better to qualify hard (BANT, MEDDIC) and talk to fewer, better-fit prospects? Or cast a wide net and let the product qualify itself?

3. **Methodology Choice**: BANT, MEDDIC, Challenger, Sandler—which resonates with you? Why? How would you adapt it for Bibby?

4. **Discovery vs Demo**: Most founders want to jump straight to the demo. Why is discovery first so critical? What happens if you skip it?

5. **Objection = Opportunity**: The best objections reveal what's really blocking the sale. How do you create space for objections instead of avoiding them?

6. **Forecasting Accuracy**: Early-stage forecasts are always wrong. How do you balance optimism (to motivate the team) with realism (to plan cash flow)?

7. **Founder-Led Sales**: As a technical founder, you'll likely do the first 10-50 sales yourself. What's the mindset shift from "I hate sales" to "I'm the best person to sell this"?

8. **Scaling Yourself**: At some point, you'll need to hire salespeople. What parts of your sales process can be taught? What requires deep product/market knowledge?

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Sales is a process, not magic**: SQL → Qualification → Discovery → Demo → Trial → Negotiation → Close. Each stage is repeatable.

2. **Discovery > Demo**: Understanding their problem matters more than showing features. SPIN (Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-Payoff) uncovers real pain.

3. **Methodology matters**: BANT for quick qualification. MEDDIC for enterprise. Challenger for education. Sandler for control. Pick the right tool for your deal size and sales cycle.

4. **Objections are buying signals**: "It's too expensive" = "I'm considering this." Handle objections with LAER (Listen, Acknowledge, Explore, Respond).

5. **Forecasting enables planning**: Weighted pipeline (stage × probability) predicts future revenue. Commit, Best Case, Pipeline give you range.

6. **The first 10 customers are on you**: As a founder, you can't outsource sales until you've proven the playbook yourself.

7. **Metrics drive improvement**: Track win rate, sales cycle, deal size, pipeline coverage. What gets measured gets optimized.

8. **Disqualify fast**: Spending time on bad-fit prospects is worse than having no prospects. Qualify hard, disqualify fast, focus on winners.

---

## What's Next?

You now have a repeatable sales process that turns qualified leads into paying customers. But customer acquisition is only half the equation—you also need to keep them.

**Next week: Product-Led Growth Mechanics**

You'll learn how to:
- Design product experiences that drive viral growth
- Build growth loops into your product
- Reduce friction in onboarding and activation
- Use product data to identify expansion opportunities
- Create network effects
- Build a self-serve upgrade path

Plus: How to turn Bibby into a product-led growth engine.

**Mentor Voice This Week**: **Technical Founder** (Builder who had to learn sales the hard way)

*"I used to think sales was sleazy—convincing people to buy things they don't need. Then I started a company and realized: Sales is problem-solving. If you've built something valuable and someone has the problem you solve, helping them buy is a service, not manipulation. The best sales process isn't about persuasion—it's about education, qualification, and clarity. You're not selling; you're helping them buy."*

**Progress Check**: **29/52 weeks complete** (56% of total apprenticeship)

**Semesters**:
- ✅ Semester 1: Systems Thinking & Technical Foundation (Weeks 1-13)
- ✅ Semester 2: Metrics, Economics & Strategy (Weeks 14-26)
- 🔄 Semester 3: Marketing, Go-to-Market & Growth (Weeks 27-39) ← **You are here (Week 29)**
- ⏳ Semester 4: Execution, Revenue & Scale (Weeks 40-52)

You're building a complete go-to-market motion: Demand gen fills the pipeline → Sales process closes deals → Next week, you'll learn how the product itself drives growth. This is where it all comes together.
