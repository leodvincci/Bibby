## Introduction: The Fundraising Game

You've built a solid financial model. Bibby is projected to hit $21M ARR in 5 years with healthy unit economics (LTV:CAC 7.6:1). You know your channel economics, segment profitability, and leverage points.

But there's a problem: **You need capital to get there.**

Your current burn rate is $38K/month. At that rate, your $500K seed runs out in Month 14. You need to raise before you run out of runway, ideally with 6+ months of cash remaining.

Welcome to **fundraising**—the most misunderstood, most stressful, and most critical skill for startup founders.

Here's what most engineers get wrong about fundraising:

**Myth**: "If I build a great product, investors will find me."
**Reality**: Fundraising is sales. You need to hustle, network, pitch, and close.

**Myth**: "Investors invest in ideas."
**Reality**: Pre-seed/seed investors invest in **people**. Series A+ investors invest in **traction**.

**Myth**: "VCs are rational and evaluate opportunities objectively."
**Reality**: VCs are driven by FOMO, pattern matching, and social proof.

This week you'll learn:
1. **How venture capital works** (fund economics, GP/LP dynamics, decision-making)
2. **Fundraising stages** (pre-seed → seed → Series A → B → C)
3. **What investors look for** (the 4 pillars: team, market, product, traction)
4. **The fundraising process** (timeline, cadence, creating FOMO)
5. **Common mistakes** (and how to avoid them)
6. **Building your fundraising pipeline** (tracking outreach like a sales CRM)

By the end, you'll understand how to raise capital without giving away your company.

## Part 1: How Venture Capital Works

Before you can raise from VCs, you need to understand how their business works.

### VC Fund Structure

A venture capital fund has two types of people:

1. **General Partners (GPs)**: The investors who run the fund, make decisions, sit on boards
2. **Limited Partners (LPs)**: The money sources (pension funds, endowments, family offices, wealthy individuals)

**How it works:**
- LPs give GPs money (e.g., $100M fund)
- GPs invest that money in startups over 3-5 years
- GPs charge LPs:
  - **Management fee**: 2% of fund per year (to cover salaries, operations)
  - **Carry**: 20% of profits above the fund size

**Example:**
- Fund size: $100M
- Management fee: 2% × $100M = $2M/year (GPs' salary)
- If fund returns $300M (3× return):
  - LPs get: $100M (original) + 80% of $200M profit = $260M
  - GPs get: 20% of $200M profit = $40M (carry)

### Why This Matters to You

**VCs need 10× returns to make their fund work.**

Here's why:
- Typical VC fund invests in 20-30 companies
- ~70% will fail (return 0×)
- ~20% will return 1-3× (small wins)
- ~10% will return 10-100× (the "winners")

**The math:**
- 20 companies × $500K each = $10M invested
- 14 fail: $7M lost
- 4 return 2×: $4M
- 2 return 20×: $20M
- **Total return: $24M on $10M invested = 2.4× fund**

To get to 3× fund (good) or 5× fund (great), they need those 2 winners to return 50-100×.

**This means:**
- VCs are looking for companies that can return their entire fund (become $1B+ "unicorns")
- They're not interested in "nice businesses" that might sell for $50M
- They're pattern-matching for billion-dollar potential

### VC Decision-Making Process

**How VCs decide:**

1. **Partner meeting**: One partner "champions" your deal
2. **Diligence**: Team does reference checks, market analysis, financial review
3. **Partner vote**: All partners vote (usually need majority or consensus)
4. **Term sheet**: Formal offer with valuation and terms
5. **Legal/close**: 2-4 weeks of paperwork

**Red flags that kill deals:**
- Team issues (co-founder conflict, bad references)
- Market too small (can't get to $1B outcome)
- Unit economics don't work (LTV < CAC)
- Traction too slow (not hitting milestones)

**What accelerates deals:**
- Multiple term sheets (FOMO)
- Impressive traction (40%+ MoM growth)
- Amazing team (second-time founder, domain expert)
- Hot market (everyone is investing in AI, fintech, etc.)

## Part 2: Fundraising Stages

Startup funding happens in stages, each with different expectations and valuations.

### Stage Breakdown

| Stage | Valuation | Amount Raised | Dilution | What You Need |
|-------|-----------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **Pre-seed** | $2-5M | $100K-$500K | 10-15% | Idea + team + prototype |
| **Seed** | $5-15M | $500K-$3M | 15-25% | Product + early traction (10-50 customers) |
| **Series A** | $15-50M | $3-15M | 20-30% | Product-market fit + $1M+ ARR + strong growth |
| **Series B** | $50-150M | $15-50M | 15-25% | Scale + $5-10M ARR + proven GTM |
| **Series C+** | $150M+ | $50M+ | 10-20% | Dominance + path to IPO/exit |

### Pre-Seed: The Friends & Family Round

**Who invests:** Angels, friends, family, micro-VCs
**Ticket size:** $10K-$100K per investor
**What they want:** Belief in you + FOMO on your vision

**Your pitch:**
- Problem you're solving (personal story helps)
- Why you're the right person to solve it
- Vision for what this could become
- Ask: "I'm raising $250K to build the MVP and get first 50 customers"

**Example:**
> "I spent 6 years in industrial operations at Kinder Morgan. I saw firsthand how teams waste hours tracking technical documentation. Bibby is a CLI-first library management system for developers. We're raising $250K to launch and acquire our first 100 customers."

**Valuation:** Pre-seed is often done on a **SAFE** (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) or **convertible note**—you don't set a valuation yet, it converts to equity in your next round.

### Seed: Proving the Concept

**Who invests:** Seed VCs, super angels, accelerators (Y Combinator, Techstars)
**Ticket size:** $100K-$500K per investor
**What they want:** Early traction + clear path to product-market fit

**Milestones to hit:**
- Product launched (not just prototype)
- 10-100 paying customers
- $10K-$50K MRR
- Evidence of product-market fit (NPS > 50, retention > 90% at M3)

**Your pitch:**
- Problem + solution + traction
- Unit economics (LTV, CAC, payback)
- Go-to-market strategy (how you'll scale)
- Ask: "We're raising $1.5M to scale from $30K MRR to $200K MRR in 18 months"

**Valuation:** $5-15M post-money (you'll give up 15-25% equity)

### Series A: Proving the Business

**Who invests:** Traditional VCs (Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, etc.)
**Ticket size:** $3-15M
**What they want:** Product-market fit + scalable GTM + strong unit economics

**Milestones to hit:**
- $1-2M ARR
- 30-40% YoY growth
- LTV:CAC > 3.0
- CAC payback < 12 months
- Clear path to $10M ARR

**Your pitch:**
- Market size (TAM > $1B)
- Proven GTM motion (repeatable sales process)
- Strong unit economics
- Path to $100M+ ARR
- Ask: "We're raising $8M to scale from $2M to $10M ARR"

**Valuation:** $20-50M post-money (20-30% dilution)

### Series B and Beyond

**Series B**: Scale the proven model ($5-10M ARR → $25-50M ARR)
**Series C**: Dominate the market ($50M+ ARR, expand internationally, M&A)

At this point, you're playing a different game—institutional investors, board management, preparing for IPO or acquisition.

## Part 3: What Investors Look For—The 4 Pillars

Every pitch deck is evaluated on **4 pillars**:

### 1. Team (30% weight)

**What they're evaluating:**
- Can this team execute?
- Have they built/sold before?
- Do they have domain expertise?
- Are they coachable?
- Will they work well together for 10 years?

**What makes a great team:**
- **Second-time founders** (you've done this before)
- **Domain experts** (10+ years in the industry)
- **Complementary skills** (technical co-founder + business co-founder)
- **Velocity** (ship fast, iterate quickly)
- **Grit** (won't give up when things get hard)

**Your advantage (for Bibby):**
- Navy veteran (demonstrates grit, discipline)
- Kinder Morgan operations (domain expertise in technical systems)
- Self-taught engineer (shows learning velocity)

**What to highlight:**
> "I'm a Navy veteran and spent 6 years optimizing operations at Kinder Morgan, where I saw teams waste 20+ hours/week managing technical docs. I taught myself Java/Spring Boot and built Bibby to solve this. I'm technical, I know the problem deeply, and I execute fast."

### 2. Market (25% weight)

**What they're evaluating:**
- Is the market big enough? (TAM > $1B)
- Is it growing? (10%+ YoY)
- Can this company capture 5-10% of the market?
- Is timing right? (Why now?)

**What makes a great market:**
- **Large TAM** ($10B+)
- **Fragmented** (no dominant player)
- **Growing fast** (tailwinds: cloud adoption, remote work, AI, etc.)
- **Underserved** (current solutions suck)

**For Bibby:**
- TAM: Developer tools market ($30B+)
- Growing: Developer population growing 20% YoY
- Underserved: No CLI-first library management for developers
- Timing: DevOps/CLI renaissance (everything moving to terminal)

### 3. Product (20% weight)

**What they're evaluating:**
- Is this product 10× better than alternatives?
- Do customers love it? (NPS > 50)
- Is there product-market fit? (retention curves flattening)
- Can it scale? (technical architecture supports growth)

**What makes a great product:**
- **Love, not like** (customers rave about it)
- **Fast time-to-value** (activate in minutes, not weeks)
- **Sticky** (daily active usage, hard to churn)
- **Defensible** (network effects, data moats, switching costs)

**For Bibby:**
- 10× better: CLI-first vs web UI (faster for developers)
- Time-to-value: `brew install bibby` → managing books in 2 minutes
- Sticky: Daily usage for developers who live in terminal

### 4. Traction (25% weight)

**What they're evaluating:**
- Are you growing? (MoM growth rate)
- Are customers paying? (revenue, not just users)
- Are unit economics healthy? (LTV:CAC > 3.0)
- Is there momentum? (accelerating, not plateauing)

**What makes great traction:**

**Pre-seed/Seed:**
- 20-50 paying customers
- $10K-$50K MRR
- 20%+ MoM growth
- Strong retention (>90% at M3)

**Series A:**
- $1-2M ARR
- 15%+ MoM growth (3× YoY)
- LTV:CAC > 3.0
- NRR > 100% (net revenue retention)

**The traction slide is the most important slide in your deck.**

## Part 4: The Fundraising Process—Creating FOMO

Fundraising is not a passive activity. You don't "wait for investors to be interested." You actively create demand.

### The 8-Week Fundraising Sprint

**Week 1-2: Preparation**
- Build pitch deck (Week 22 will cover this)
- Finalize financial model
- Create investor target list (50-100 investors)
- Get warm intros (avoid cold emails)

**Week 3-4: Initial meetings**
- 20-30 first meetings
- Gather feedback, refine pitch
- Identify 5-10 interested investors

**Week 5-6: Partner meetings**
- Present to full partnership
- Provide data room access (metrics, financials, contracts)
- Answer diligence questions

**Week 7: Term sheets**
- Hopefully get 2-3 term sheets
- Create FOMO (let investors know you have multiple offers)
- Negotiate terms

**Week 8: Close**
- Sign term sheet with best investor
- Complete legal paperwork
- Wire hits bank account 🎉

### Creating FOMO—The Investor Psychology

**Key principle: Investors want what other investors want.**

Here's how to create FOMO:

1. **Run a tight process** (8 weeks, no more)
   - "We're planning to close by end of quarter"
   - Creates urgency

2. **Talk to 50+ investors in parallel**
   - If you're only talking to 3 investors, they'll slow-play you
   - If you're talking to 50, you'll get multiple term sheets

3. **Use social proof**
   - "Sequoia and a16z are both doing diligence right now"
   - Investors are sheep—they follow each other

4. **Manufacture urgency**
   - "We have a term sheet from [top-tier VC]. We really like you too, but we need to decide by Friday."
   - This works every time

5. **Be willing to walk away**
   - If you act desperate, you get terrible terms
   - If you act like you don't need the money, you get great terms

### Building Your Investor Pipeline

Treat fundraising like a **sales pipeline**.

## Part 5: Common Fundraising Mistakes

I've raised 4 rounds across 2 companies. Here are the mistakes I made (so you don't have to):

### Mistake 1: Starting Too Late

**What I did wrong:** Started fundraising with 3 months of runway left.

**Why it's bad:**
- You're desperate
- Investors smell blood
- You accept terrible terms
- You might run out of money mid-raise

**What to do instead:** Start fundraising when you have 6-9 months of runway. This gives you leverage.

### Mistake 2: Talking to Too Few Investors

**What I did wrong:** Talked to 5 investors for my first round.

**Why it's bad:**
- No FOMO
- Investors slow-play you
- You don't get competing term sheets
- One "no" feels devastating

**What to do instead:** Talk to 50-100 investors in parallel. This creates competition and gives you options.

### Mistake 3: Optimizing for Valuation Over Everything

**What I did wrong:** Took the highest valuation offer ($12M) from a VC I didn't like.

**Why it's bad:**
- Wrong investor = bad board member for 5+ years
- High valuation = high expectations (hard to raise next round)
- Realized later: $10M from the right investor > $12M from wrong one

**What to do instead:** Optimize for:
1. **Investor quality** (will they help you win?)
2. **Term quality** (liquidation preferences, board seats, pro-rata rights)
3. **Valuation** (important, but not everything)

### Mistake 4: No Warm Intros

**What I did wrong:** Cold emailed 30 VCs. Got 0 responses.

**Why it's bad:**
- VCs get 1,000+ cold emails per month
- Cold emails have ~1% response rate
- Warm intros have ~60% response rate

**What to do instead:**
- Use LinkedIn to find connections
- Ask advisors, customers, other founders for intros
- Attend VC events, demo days, conferences

### Mistake 5: Raising on a Trough

**What I did wrong:** Tried to raise right after our growth stalled (went from 20% MoM → 5% MoM).

**Why it's bad:**
- Investors extrapolate current trajectory
- Declining growth = hard pass
- You won't get good terms

**What to do instead:**
- Raise when momentum is strong (growth accelerating)
- If growth stalls, fix it THEN raise
- "Time fundraising to your peaks, not your troughs"

### Mistake 6: Not Building Relationships Early

**What I did wrong:** Only talked to VCs when I needed money.

**Why it's bad:**
- VCs want to "watch you work" before investing
- Cold outreach = starting from zero trust
- Relationships take 6-12 months to build

**What to do instead:**
- Start building relationships 12 months before you raise
- Send quarterly updates to potential investors
- Ask for advice (not money) in early conversations
- When you're ready to raise, they already know/trust you

## Part 6: The Fundraising Email Templates

Here are battle-tested email templates for each stage:

### Template 1: Requesting a Warm Intro

```
Subject: Intro to [Investor Name] at [VC Firm]?

Hi [Connector Name],

Hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out because I'm raising our seed round for Bibby (CLI-first library management for developers), and I'd love an introduction to [Investor Name] at [VC Firm].

Why this is a fit:
• [VC Firm] has invested in [similar company 1] and [similar company 2]
• We're in their sweet spot: B2B SaaS, DevTools, $500K-$1M check
• We have strong early traction: $40K MRR, 30% MoM growth

Would you be comfortable making an intro? Happy to provide a forwardable blurb.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

### Template 2: The Forwardable Blurb

```
[This is what your connector forwards to the investor]

Subject: Intro: [Your Name] (Bibby) <> [Investor Name]

Hi [Investor Name],

I'd like to introduce you to [Your Name], founder of Bibby. They're raising a $1.5M seed round and I think this could be interesting for [VC Firm].

Quick context:
• Problem: Developers waste 10+ hours/week managing technical documentation
• Solution: CLI-first library management system (think Spotify for books, but for developers)
• Traction: $40K MRR, 350 paying customers, 30% MoM growth
• Team: Navy veteran, 6 years at Kinder Morgan, self-taught engineer
• Raising: $1.5M to scale to $200K MRR

[Your Name], meet [Investor Name]. [Investor Name], meet [Your Name].

I'll let you take it from here!
```

### Template 3: Following Up After First Meeting

```
Subject: Re: Bibby - Following up

Hi [Investor Name],

Thanks for taking the time yesterday! I really enjoyed discussing [specific thing you talked about].

A few follow-ups based on our conversation:

1. You asked about our retention curves - attached is cohort analysis showing 92% retention at M6
2. You mentioned concern about market size - I've added TAM/SAM/SOM breakdown to our deck (slide 6)
3. You wanted to see our financial model - shared via Google Sheets [link]

Next steps:
• I'm talking to [other top-tier VCs] over the next 2 weeks
• Planning to close the round by end of quarter
• Would love to get you to a partner meeting if this is interesting

Let me know if you need anything else!

[Your Name]
```

### Template 4: Creating FOMO

```
Subject: Bibby - Quick timing update

Hi [Investor Name],

Quick update: we've received a term sheet from [Top-Tier VC] and are in final diligence with [Another VC].

We really enjoyed our conversation and would love to work with you, but we need to make a decision by [Date - 5 days from now].

If this is something you'd like to pursue, let me know and I can share the term sheet details. Otherwise, totally understand if the timing doesn't work.

Either way, appreciate your time!

[Your Name]
```

5. **Reflection** (300 words):
   - If you were raising for Bibby today, which 5 investors would you target first? Why?
   - What's your biggest concern about fundraising?
   - How would you create FOMO if you only have 1 interested investor?

---

## Reflection Questions

1. **Why do VCs need 10× returns? How does this shape their investment decisions?**

2. **At what stage should Bibby raise? Pre-seed, seed, or wait for Series A traction?**

3. **If you could only optimize for one thing when choosing an investor, what would it be: valuation, investor brand, or strategic value? Why?**

4. **Why is talking to 50+ investors better than talking to 5, even if those 5 are "perfect fit" VCs?**

5. **What's the biggest mistake you think first-time founders make when fundraising? How would you avoid it?**

6. **Should you raise at all? When does bootstrapping make more sense than taking VC money?**

---

## From the Mentor: Fundraising Is a Necessary Evil

Here's the truth about fundraising:

**It's a distraction.** Every hour you spend pitching VCs is an hour you're not building product, talking to customers, or growing revenue. I've seen founders spend 6 months fundraising and come back to a business that's stalled.

**But it's necessary.** If you want to build a $100M+ company, you need capital to scale. You can't bootstrap your way to dominance in a competitive market.

**My advice:**

1. **Raise when you have momentum.** The best time to raise is when you don't need the money. You have leverage.

2. **Run a tight process.** 8 weeks, no more. Any longer and you'll burn out and your business will suffer.

3. **Pick your investors carefully.** You're going to be in business with them for 5-10 years. Make sure you like them.

4. **Don't optimize for valuation.** A $15M valuation from a great investor beats a $20M valuation from a mediocre one.

5. **Build relationships early.** Start talking to VCs 12 months before you need money. When it's time to raise, you'll have warm relationships.

I've raised $28M across 4 rounds. It never gets easier, but it gets more familiar. The first round is the hardest because you're unproven. But if you execute, build traction, and create FOMO, you'll close the round.

Now go build your pipeline.

## Key Takeaways

1. **VC economics drive behavior**—they need 10× returns, so they're looking for unicorn potential
2. **Fundraising stages have clear milestones**—know what traction you need for each stage
3. **4 pillars matter**—team (30%), market (25%), traction (25%), product (20%)
4. **Run a tight process**—8 weeks, 50+ investors in parallel, create FOMO
5. **Warm intros are 60× better than cold emails**—build relationships 12 months early
6. **Track your pipeline like sales**—use a CRM approach to manage investor relationships
7. **Common mistakes are avoidable**—start early, talk to many, optimize for investor quality
