# Week 24: Board Management & Governance

**Semester 2, Week 10**
**Mentor Voice: Senior Architect**
**Reading Time: 50 minutes**

## Introduction: Your Board Is a Tool—Use It Well

The wire just hit your account. $1.5M from Acme Seed Fund. You celebrated. You announced on Twitter. Now it's Monday morning and you get an email from Jessica Park:

> "Congrats on closing! Let's schedule our first board meeting for next month. Can you send a board deck 48 hours before? Looking forward to working together!"

Suddenly you realize: **You have a board of directors now.**

For the next 5-10 years, you'll report to this board quarterly. They'll scrutinize your metrics, challenge your strategy, and vote on major decisions. Get this relationship right and they'll be your biggest advocates, opening doors and helping you win. Get it wrong and board meetings become dreaded obligations where you defend yourself for 3 hours.

Most first-time founders make board management harder than it needs to be. They either:
- **Treat the board like bosses** (overly deferential, afraid to make decisions)
- **Treat the board like enemies** (defensive, withholding information)
- **Ignore the board** (minimal updates, surprised when investors are frustrated)

**The right approach: Treat your board like strategic advisors with veto power.**

You're the CEO. You make the decisions. But you leverage their experience, networks, and pattern recognition to make better decisions. You keep them informed so they can help. And you respect their governance role—they represent shareholders and have fiduciary duties.

This week you'll learn:
1. **Board composition and dynamics** (who sits on the board and why)
2. **Running effective board meetings** (preparation, structure, outcomes)
3. **Board deck best practices** (what to include, what to skip)
4. **Managing expectations** (under-promise, over-deliver)
5. **Delivering bad news** (transparency builds trust)
6. **Asking for help** (leverage their superpowers)
7. **Board politics** (managing disagreements and conflicts)
8. **Building toward next fundraise** (board updates as fundraising prep)

By the end, you'll know how to turn your board into a strategic asset.

---

## Part 1: Board Composition and Dynamics

### Who's on Your Board?

**Typical seed-stage board (3 seats):**
- **2 Founder seats**: You + co-founder (or you + another founder)
- **1 Investor seat**: Lead investor (e.g., Jessica from Acme Seed Fund)

**Founders have voting control** (2 out of 3 votes).

**As you scale:**

**Series A (5 seats):**
- 2 Founder seats
- 2 Investor seats (Series A lead + seed investor)
- 1 Independent director (someone with relevant expertise, no financial stake)

**Series B+ (7+ seats):**
- 2 Founder seats
- 3+ Investor seats
- 2+ Independent directors

**At some point, investors will have voting control.** This is normal at later stages.

### Board Roles and Responsibilities

**The board's job:**
1. **Hire and fire the CEO** (that's you—if you fail, they replace you)
2. **Approve major corporate actions** (selling the company, raising capital, issuing shares)
3. **Provide strategic guidance** (leverage their experience)
4. **Open doors** (intros to customers, partners, future investors)
5. **Fiduciary duty** (protect all shareholders' interests)

**The board does NOT:**
- Run the company day-to-day
- Micromanage hiring, product, or strategy
- Make operational decisions

**You're the CEO. They're advisors with governance authority.**

### Board Member Types and How to Work With Each

**1. The Operator (Former CEO/CXO)**

**Profile:**
- Built and scaled companies before
- Pattern recognition from experience
- Impatient with slow execution

**How to work with them:**
- Ask: "What would you do in my situation?"
- Leverage: Intros to talent, customers, partners
- Watch out: Can be overly prescriptive ("You should do X")

**2. The VC Partner (Professional Investor)**

**Profile:**
- Sees 100+ companies per year
- Knows market trends and competitive landscape
- Focused on fund returns

**How to work with them:**
- Ask: "What are you seeing in the market?"
- Leverage: Intros to other portfolio companies, future investors
- Watch out: May push for growth over profitability

**3. The Domain Expert (Industry Veteran)**

**Profile:**
- 20+ years in your industry
- Deep customer/partner relationships
- Cares about the mission, not just returns

**How to work with them:**
- Ask: "Who should we be talking to?"
- Leverage: Customer intros, market insights, product feedback
- Watch out: May resist innovation ("That's not how we did it")

**4. The Independent Director (Neutral Tiebreaker)**

**Profile:**
- No financial stake (or small stake)
- Often a successful founder/exec
- Balances founder and investor interests

**How to work with them:**
- Ask: "What's the right call here?"
- Leverage: Mediation in founder/investor conflicts
- Watch out: Less engaged than investors (they don't have money on the line)

### Board Dynamics—Power and Politics

**Early stage (seed/Series A):**
- Founders have control
- Investors are in "support mode"
- Meetings are collaborative

**Growth stage (Series B+):**
- Investors have control
- Board becomes more formal
- Meetings can become contentious if metrics slip

**The shift happens when:**
- You miss targets (growth slows, burn increases)
- Investors lose confidence in leadership
- Market changes and strategy needs to pivot

**Your job:** Build trust early so when things get hard, the board supports you instead of replacing you.

## Part 2: Running Effective Board Meetings

### The Quarterly Board Meeting Structure

**Frequency:**
- **Seed/Series A**: Quarterly (every 3 months)
- **Series B+**: Monthly or quarterly (depending on performance)
- **Crisis mode**: Monthly or biweekly

**Duration:** 2-3 hours

**Format:**

**Part 1: CEO Presentation (60 minutes)**
- Walk through board deck (sent 48 hours before)
- Metrics, wins, challenges, strategy
- Q&A throughout (encourage interruptions)

**Part 2: Deep Dive Discussion (45 minutes)**
- Focus on 1-2 strategic topics
- Examples: "Should we pivot to enterprise?" or "Do we need to hire a VP Sales?"
- Get board input and debate

**Part 3: Executive Session (15 minutes)**
- Board only (CEO leaves the room)
- Investors discuss CEO performance, concerns, etc.
- Then CEO comes back for feedback

**Part 4: Wrap-Up (15 minutes)**
- Action items
- Next steps
- Next meeting date

### Pre-Meeting Preparation (Critical)

**2 weeks before:**
- Draft board deck
- Gather metrics from team
- Identify 2-3 strategic questions for board input

**48 hours before:**
- **Send final board deck** (investors need time to read)
- Include:
  - Deck (PDF)
  - Detailed metrics spreadsheet
  - Any pre-reads (articles, reports, competitive analysis)

**Day before:**
- Review deck, practice presentation
- Anticipate questions
- Prepare backup slides for deep dives

**Morning of:**
- Print copies (some board members like paper)
- Set up video call (if remote)
- Have CFO/key execs ready to present their sections

### During the Meeting: Best Practices

**1. Start with a win**
> "Before we dive into metrics, I want to share that we just signed our first enterprise customer—$50K ARR. This validates our upmarket strategy."

Sets a positive tone.

**2. Present bad news directly**
> "Churn spiked to 4% this quarter. Here's why, and here's what we're doing about it."

Don't sugarcoat. Board members respect transparency.

**3. Ask for specific help**
> "We're struggling to hire a VP Engineering. Jessica, your portfolio company Stripe just scaled eng to 50 people—can you intro me to their recruiter?"

Boards want to help. Tell them exactly how.

**4. Encourage debate**
> "We're debating whether to expand to Europe or double down on North America. I'd love to hear your perspectives."

Best boards challenge your thinking.

**5. End with clear action items**
> "Action items: Sarah will intro me to 3 VP Eng candidates by next week. Mike will review our pricing model and send feedback. I'll send a memo on the Europe expansion decision by end of month."

### After the Meeting

**Within 24 hours:**
- Send meeting minutes (decisions made, action items)
- Include: Attendance, key decisions, votes (if any), next meeting date

**Within 1 week:**
- Follow up on action items
- Send any requested materials

**Between meetings (monthly):**
- Send investor updates via email (more on this later)
- Keep board warm on traction, challenges, asks

---

### What Good Board Decks Have in Common

**1. Metrics first, narrative second**
- Show the data clearly
- Then explain what it means

**2. Trend lines, not point-in-time**
- Show 6-12 months of history
- Let them see trajectory

**3. Variance analysis**
- "We planned 100 new customers, we got 85. Here's why."
- Show plan vs actual

**4. Red/yellow/green indicators**
- Make it easy to see what's working and what's not
- Green = on track, Yellow = watch, Red = problem

**5. Forward-looking**
- "Here's what we're doing next quarter"
- Not just backward-looking recap

### What to Avoid

**Don't:**
- Surprise them (bad news should be in the deck, not sprung in the meeting)
- Use vanity metrics (total users instead of paying customers)
- Overload with detail (save it for appendix)
- Blame externalities ("We missed targets because of the economy")
- Make excuses

---

## Part 4: Managing Expectations—Under-Promise, Over-Deliver

**The golden rule:** Set conservative targets and beat them.

### How to Set Targets

**Bad approach:**
> "We think we can get to 200 new customers next quarter if everything goes well."

**Better approach:**
> "Our model says 150-200 customers next quarter. We're targeting 150 to be conservative."

Then you deliver 170 and you're a hero.

### Forecasting Framework

When projecting, use **three scenarios**:

**Conservative (80% confidence):**
- "We're highly confident we'll hit this"
- This is your committed forecast

**Expected (50% confidence):**
- "This is our realistic expectation"
- Your internal plan

**Stretch (20% confidence):**
- "If everything breaks right"
- Your aspirational goal

**Report the conservative number to the board.**

### When You Miss Targets

**It will happen.** Here's how to handle it:

**1. Don't wait for the board meeting**
- Email or call your lead investor within 24 hours of realizing you'll miss
- "Quick heads up: We're tracking to 85 new customers this quarter, not the 100 we projected. Here's why..."

**2. Explain clearly:**
- **What happened:** "Conversion rate dropped from 10% to 8%"
- **Why:** "Two issues: pricing experiment backfired + competitor launched aggressive campaign"
- **What you're doing:** "Rolled back pricing. Launching new feature to counter competitor."
- **Revised forecast:** "Expect to recover by end of next quarter"

**3. Own it**
- Don't blame the market, the team, bad luck
- "I made a mistake. I should have tested pricing more carefully before rolling out."

**Boards respect accountability.**

---

## Part 5: Delivering Bad News

**The hardest part of board management:** Telling investors things are not going well.

### The Bad News Framework

**Step 1: Get in front of it early**
- Don't wait until it's a crisis
- "We're seeing early signs of X. Here's what we're monitoring."

**Step 2: Be direct**
- No sugarcoating
- "Our lead engineer quit. This will delay our product roadmap by 6 weeks."

**Step 3: Provide context**
- Explain why this happened
- "He got an offer from Google at 2× comp. We couldn't match."

**Step 4: Present your plan**
- "We're promoting our senior engineer to lead. We're also hiring 2 more engineers with the raise money. Revised roadmap attached."

**Step 5: Ask for help**
- "If anyone knows great engineering talent, we'd love intros."

### Examples of Bad News and How to Deliver It

**Scenario 1: Churn Spiked**

**Bad:**
> "Churn is up this quarter. We're not sure why. We're looking into it."

**Good:**
> "Churn increased from 2.5% to 4.5%. We've identified the cause: customers who don't activate within 7 days churn at 8% vs 2% for activated users. We've launched a new onboarding flow. Early results show 20% improvement in 7-day activation. We expect churn to normalize to 3% next quarter."

**Scenario 2: Missed Revenue Target**

**Bad:**
> "We missed our target. The market is tough right now."

**Good:**
> "We did $180K MRR vs our $200K target. Two factors: (1) larger deals are taking 3 months to close instead of 2, (2) we lost two enterprise prospects to Competitor X. We're adjusting our sales cycle assumptions and building competitive features. Q2 forecast: $220K MRR (we're being conservative)."

**Scenario 3: Co-founder Departing**

**Bad:**
> "My co-founder is leaving. We'll figure it out."

**Good:**
> "My co-founder Sarah is leaving to pursue another opportunity. This was amicable—she's staying for 30 days to transition. Here's our plan: I'm taking over her responsibilities (sales) and hiring a VP Sales within 60 days. No disruption to customers or roadmap. Sarah will remain an advisor."

### What Boards Hate

**1. Surprises**
- Finding out bad news in the board meeting
- Feeling blindsided

**2. Excuses**
- Blaming the market, competitors, team, bad luck
- Not taking ownership

**3. No plan**
- Presenting problems without solutions
- "We're not sure what to do"

**What boards respect:**
- **Transparency**: Tell them everything, good and bad
- **Accountability**: Own your mistakes
- **Action**: Always have a plan

---

## Part 6: Asking for Help—Leverage Their Superpowers

Your board has collective:
- 50+ years of operating experience
- 100+ portfolio company relationships
- Thousands of connections

**Use them.**

### The 4 Areas Where Boards Can Help

**1. Strategic Guidance**

**Ask:**
> "We're debating whether to build a mobile app or double down on web. Here's our analysis [attach memo]. I'd love your perspective before we decide."

**Why this works:** Gives them context and makes the ask specific.

**2. Customer & Partner Intros**

**Ask:**
> "We're trying to land our first enterprise customer in healthcare. Jessica, I know you invested in HealthTech Corp—can you intro me to their CTO?"

**Why this works:** Specific ask, relevant to their network.

**3. Recruiting**

**Ask:**
> "We're hiring a VP Marketing. Ideal profile: B2B SaaS, product-led growth, scaled 0 to $10M. Anyone from your portfolios you'd recommend?"

**Why this works:** Clear profile makes it easy for them to pattern match.

**4. Future Fundraising**

**Ask:**
> "We'll be raising Series A in 9 months. Which firms should we start building relationships with? Can you intro me to 2-3 partners?"

**Why this works:** Gives them lead time to make intros.

### How NOT to Ask for Help

**Bad ask #1: Too vague**
> "Can you help with sales?"

(Help how? Intros? Strategy? Hiring?)

**Bad ask #2: Too broad**
> "Do you know anyone in developer tools?"

(Know them for what purpose?)

**Bad ask #3: No context**
> "Can you intro me to your friend at Google?"

(Why? For what?)

**Good asks are:**
1. Specific (exactly what you need)
2. Contextualized (why you need it)
3. Easy to act on (low friction)

---

## Part 7: Board Politics and Managing Conflicts

Not all board meetings are smooth. Sometimes investors disagree with you or each other.

### Common Board Conflicts

**Conflict 1: Investor Wants Faster Growth, You Want Profitability**

**Their position:** "You should be growing 40% MoM. Burn more on marketing."

**Your position:** "We're growing 15% MoM sustainably. Burning more = bad unit economics."

**How to resolve:**
- Show the data: "When we increased marketing spend 50%, CAC went from $80 → $200, LTV:CAC dropped below 3:1."
- Propose a test: "Let's run a $10K experiment. If LTV:CAC stays above 3:1, we'll scale."
- Align on goals: "We both want to build a big company. I want to make sure we do it sustainably."

**Conflict 2: Board Wants You to Hire Executive, You Think It's Too Early**

**Their position:** "You need a VP Sales now. You can't scale without one."

**Your position:** "We don't have enough revenue to hire a $200K+ exec. I want to wait until $1M ARR."

**How to resolve:**
- Propose a compromise: "Let's hire a Director of Sales at $120K now, promote to VP when we hit $1M."
- Ask for data: "What stage did your other portfolio companies hire VP Sales? What was the ROI?"
- Set a trigger: "If we hit $750K ARR this quarter, I'll start the search immediately."

**Conflict 3: Investors Disagree With Each Other**

**Investor A:** "Focus on SMB, that's where the volume is."
**Investor B:** "Go upmarket to enterprise, that's where the money is."

**How to resolve:**
- Synthesize their inputs: "You both make good points. Here's what I'm thinking: We focus on mid-market. It's the sweet spot—higher ARPA than SMB, faster sales cycle than enterprise."
- Ask for a tiebreaker: "Independent director, what do you think?"
- Make the call: "I appreciate both perspectives. After weighing the data, we're going with mid-market. I'll report back next quarter on results."

### Your Authority as CEO

**Remember:** You're the CEO. The board advises. You decide.

**You should:**
- Listen to their input (they have valuable experience)
- Synthesize their perspectives
- Make the final call
- Communicate clearly and execute

**You should NOT:**
- Let them make operational decisions
- Implement every suggestion (they sometimes conflict)
- Be afraid to push back with data

**The board's job is to challenge you. Your job is to make the right call.**

---

## Part 8: Monthly Investor Updates—Staying Connected Between Board Meetings

Board meetings are quarterly. But you should communicate monthly.

### The Monthly Investor Update Email

**Format:**

```
Subject: Bibby Update - March 2025

Hey team,

Quick monthly update on Bibby:

📊 METRICS
• MRR: $52K (+15% MoM)
• New customers: 98 (vs 95 goal)
• Churn: 2.8% (target: <3%)
• Runway: 14 months

🎉 WINS
• Signed first enterprise customer ($50K ARR)
• Shipped AI-powered book recommendations
• Hired VP Marketing (starts next week)

📉 CHALLENGES
• Sales cycle lengthening (60 → 75 days for enterprise)
• Two key engineers interviewing elsewhere
• Competitor X launched similar feature

🎯 FOCUS NEXT MONTH
• Close 3 more enterprise deals in pipeline
• Launch retention campaign to reduce churn
• Finalize comp adjustments to retain eng team

🙏 ASKS
• Anyone know great eng talent? We're hiring 2 senior engineers.
• Looking for intros to VPs Eng at Series B+ companies for customer discovery

Thanks for your support!
[Your Name]
```

**Why this works:**
1. **Concise** (5-minute read)
2. **Data-driven** (metrics up front)
3. **Transparent** (shares challenges, not just wins)
4. **Actionable** (specific asks)

**Send this every month, even when there's "nothing to report."** Consistent updates build trust.

---

## Part 9: Building Toward Your Next Fundraise

Your board updates are not just for governance. **They're also fundraising prep.**

When you raise Series A in 18 months, your seed investors will refer you to Series A firms. Their referral will be based on:
1. **Your traction** (did you hit milestones?)
2. **Your communication** (were you transparent and responsive?)
3. **Your execution** (did you do what you said you'd do?)

### How to Set Up Series A Success

**From Month 1:**
- Set conservative milestones ("We'll hit $150K MRR in 18 months")
- Track toward them monthly
- Beat them if possible ($180K MRR = you're crushing it)

**At Month 12:**
- Start Series A prep in investor update:
  > "We're on track for Series A in Q2 2026. Planning to raise $5-8M. We'd love intros to tier-1 firms focused on devtools."

**At Month 15:**
- Ask for specific intros:
  > "Can you intro me to [Partner Name] at [VC Firm]? They invested in [Similar Company] and would be a great fit."

**At Month 18:**
- You have 10 warm intros from your board
- You've been sending quarterly updates to those firms for 6 months
- When you start formal fundraising, they already know you

**Your board becomes your sales team for the next round.**

---

## Reflection Questions

1. **What's the difference between treating your board like bosses vs treating them like advisors with veto power?**

2. **Why is "under-promise, over-deliver" more effective than "be optimistic and inspire confidence"?**

3. **When should you call your lead investor vs wait for the monthly update vs wait for the quarterly board meeting?**

4. **How do you handle a situation where your board pushes you to do something you think is wrong?**

5. **What's the right balance between leveraging your board's network vs not bothering them with too many requests?**

6. **If you had to choose between transparent communication or impressive results, which would you prioritize? Why?**

---

## From the Mentor: Your Board Can Make or Break You

Here's what I learned managing boards across 3 companies:

**Company 1: I hid problems from the board.** When churn spiked, I didn't tell them for 2 months. When they found out, they lost trust. Board meetings became interrogations. I eventually got fired.

**Company 2: I over-communicated.** Weekly updates, every small win, every small problem. Board got annoyed. "We trust you, stop bothering us with every little thing."

**Company 3: I found the balance.** Monthly updates with metrics, wins, challenges, asks. Quarterly board meetings with strategic deep dives. Called immediately when big problems came up. Board trusted me. They opened doors. When we raised Series B, all 3 board members personally called VCs to advocate for us.

**The lessons:**

**1. Transparency builds trust.** Share bad news early. Boards hate surprises.

**2. Boards want to help.** Make specific asks. "Can you help with sales?" is useless. "Can you intro me to the VP Sales at your portfolio company X?" is actionable.

**3. You're the CEO.** Listen to their input. Synthesize. Make the call. Execute. Don't be afraid to push back with data.

**4. Manage expectations.** Under-promise, over-deliver. Hit your targets.

**5. Boards are people.** They want you to win. They're cheering for you. They just need to know what's going on.

**6. Board updates are fundraising prep.** Every update is building your reputation for your next round.

I see founders treat board management as a chore. **It's not.** It's a strategic lever. Use it well and your board accelerates your company. Ignore it and they become an obstacle.

You now have the playbook. Run great board meetings, communicate transparently, leverage their networks, and they'll help you build something massive.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Treat board as strategic advisors with veto power**—not bosses, not enemies
