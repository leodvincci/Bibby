## Introduction: The Devil Is in the Details

You nailed the pitch. You created FOMO. Now you have two term sheets:

**Option A: Acme Seed Fund**
- $1.5M investment
- $8M post-money valuation
- 18.75% dilution
- 1× liquidation preference, non-participating

**Option B: Vertex Ventures**
- $1.2M investment
- $10M post-money valuation
- 12% dilution
- 2× liquidation preference, participating

Which do you take?

Most founders look at the valuation and say "Option B! Higher valuation = better deal!"

**Wrong.**

Option A is dramatically better. Here's why:

In a $30M exit:
- **Option A**: Founders get ~$24M (80% ownership)
- **Option B**: Founders get ~$16M (due to participating liquidation preference)

The participating liquidation preference in Option B means the investor gets their money back PLUS a share of the remaining proceeds. It's a trap that costs you millions.

**This is why you need to understand term sheets.**

A term sheet is not just about valuation. It's a 5-10 page document that determines:
- How much ownership you keep
- Who controls the company (board composition)
- What happens in an exit (liquidation preferences)
- How future rounds dilute you (anti-dilution provisions)
- Who can invest in future rounds (pro-rata rights)

**Get the terms wrong and you can build a $100M company and walk away with nothing.**

This week you'll learn:
1. **Term sheet anatomy** (every clause explained)
2. **The terms that matter** (focus on these 5)
3. **The terms that don't matter** (ignore these)
4. **Red flags** (deal-breakers you should never accept)
5. **Negotiation tactics** (how to get what you want)
6. **The closing process** (from term sheet to wire)

By the end, you'll be able to negotiate term sheets like a pro.

## Part 1: Term Sheet Anatomy

A typical term sheet has 4 sections:

### Section 1: Economics (Who Gets What)

**1. Valuation**
- **Pre-money valuation**: What the company is worth before the investment
- **Post-money valuation**: Pre-money + investment amount
- **Your ownership**: Post-money determines your dilution

**Example:**
- Pre-money: $6.5M
- Investment: $1.5M
- Post-money: $8M
- Investor owns: $1.5M / $8M = 18.75%
- Founders own: 81.25%

**2. Liquidation Preference**

**The most important term in the sheet.**

Determines the order and amount investors get paid in an exit (acquisition or IPO).

**Types:**

**a) 1× Non-Participating (Standard)**
- Investor gets 1× their money back OR their pro-rata share, whichever is greater
- **This is what you want**

**Example ($30M exit, $1.5M invested, 18.75% ownership):**
- Option 1: 1× money back = $1.5M
- Option 2: Pro-rata share = 18.75% × $30M = $5.625M
- Investor takes Option 2 (higher)
- Founders get: $24.375M

**b) 1× Participating (Dangerous)**
- Investor gets 1× money back PLUS pro-rata share of remaining
- **Double-dipping**

**Example (same $30M exit):**
- Investor gets: $1.5M + (18.75% × $28.5M) = $1.5M + $5.34M = $6.84M
- Founders get: $23.16M
- **You just lost $1.2M**

**c) 2× or 3× Non-Participating (Very Dangerous)**
- Investor gets 2× or 3× money back OR pro-rata share

**Example (2×, $30M exit):**
- Option 1: 2× money back = $3M
- Option 2: Pro-rata share = $5.625M
- Investor takes Option 2
- Same as 1× in good exits, but protects investor in bad exits

**In a $5M exit:**
- With 1×: Investor gets $1.5M, founders get $3.5M
- With 2×: Investor gets $3M, founders get $2M
- **You just lost $1.5M**

**d) 2× Participating (Run Away)**
- Investor gets 2× money back PLUS pro-rata
- **This is predatory**

**Example ($30M exit):**
- Investor gets: $3M + (18.75% × $27M) = $3M + $5.06M = $8.06M
- Founders get: $21.94M
- **You lost $2.4M**

**Rule of thumb:**
- ✅ Accept: 1× non-participating
- ⚠️ Negotiate: 1× participating (try to remove "participating")
- 🚨 Avoid: 2× anything, or any "participating" at high multiples

**3. Option Pool**

Stock options reserved for employees.

**Two structures:**

**a) Pre-money option pool (investor-friendly)**
- Pool created BEFORE investment
- Dilutes founders BEFORE investor comes in

**Example:**
- Pre-money: $6.5M
- Create 15% option pool
- Founders diluted to 85%
- Investment: $1.5M at $8M post
- Investor gets 18.75%, founders now have 68.6%, pool has 12.75%

**b) Post-money option pool (founder-friendly)**
- Pool created AFTER investment
- Dilutes everyone equally

**Example:**
- Pre-money: $6.5M
- Investment: $1.5M at $8M post
- Investor gets 18.75%, founders have 81.25%
- Create 15% pool → dilutes everyone
- Final: Investor 15.9%, founders 69%, pool 15%

**Rule: Negotiate for post-money option pool if possible.**

### Section 2: Control (Who Decides)

**4. Board Composition**

Who sits on the board and controls major decisions.

**Typical structures:**

**Seed stage:**
- 3 seats: 2 founders, 1 investor
- Founders maintain control

**Series A:**
- 5 seats: 2 founders, 2 investors, 1 independent
- Balanced control

**Series B+:**
- 7 seats: 2 founders, 3 investors, 2 independents
- Investors have control

**Red flags:**
- Investor-majority board at seed (you lose control too early)
- No independent seats (no tiebreaker)

**5. Protective Provisions**

Actions that require investor approval.

**Standard (reasonable):**
- Selling the company
- Raising more money
- Changing the board size
- Issuing new shares

**Overreach (avoid):**
- Hiring/firing employees
- Signing contracts over $X
- Setting budgets
- Strategic decisions

**Rule: Investors should have veto on major corporate actions, not operational control.**

### Section 3: Future Rounds

**6. Anti-Dilution Provisions**

Protects investors if you raise a down round (lower valuation than last round).

**Two types:**

**a) Full Ratchet (Very Investor-Friendly)**
- If you raise at lower price, investor's shares re-price to new price
- **This is brutal for founders**

**Example:**
- Investor buys 1M shares at $1/share
- Down round at $0.50/share
- Full ratchet: Investor now owns 2M shares (for same $1M)
- Founders get massively diluted

**b) Weighted Average (Standard)**
- Dilution is averaged across old and new shares
- Much more founder-friendly

**Rule: Accept weighted average, never accept full ratchet.**

**7. Pro-Rata Rights**

Investor's right to invest in future rounds to maintain ownership %.

**Example:**
- Investor owns 18.75%
- Series A raises $5M
- Pro-rata right: Investor can invest $937K to maintain 18.75%

**This is standard and fine.** Good investors want to follow-on.

**8. Pay-to-Play**

If investor doesn't participate in future rounds, they lose certain rights (liquidation preferences, board seat, etc.).

**This protects founders from investors who don't support you in tough times.**

### Section 4: Other Terms

**9. Vesting**

**Founder vesting**: Even founders' shares vest over time (typically 4 years, 1-year cliff).

**Why investors require it:**
- If co-founder leaves in Month 2, they shouldn't keep 50% of company
- Aligns incentives (you have to stay to earn equity)

**Standard terms:**
- 4-year vesting
- 1-year cliff (you get 25% after year 1, then monthly)
- Acceleration on acquisition (single-trigger or double-trigger)

**10. Drag-Along Rights**

If majority shareholders want to sell, they can force minority shareholders to sell too.

**This is standard.** Prevents small shareholders from blocking a good exit.

**11. No-Shop Clause**

During due diligence (30-45 days), you can't talk to other investors.

**This is standard.** Investors need time to do diligence without you shopping other offers.

## Part 2: What Terms Matter Most

Not all terms are created equal. Here's what to focus on:

### The 5 Terms That Matter

**1. Liquidation Preference (Most Important)**
- Fight for 1× non-participating
- Walk away from 2× participating

**2. Valuation (Important, But Not Everything)**
- Higher valuation = less dilution
- But bad terms can wipe out the valuation advantage

**3. Board Composition (Control)**
- Maintain founder-friendly or balanced board at seed
- Don't give up control too early

**4. Option Pool (Dilution)**
- Negotiate for post-money pool
- Or negotiate a smaller pool size

**5. Anti-Dilution (Protection)**
- Accept weighted average
- Never accept full ratchet

### The Terms That Don't Matter Much

- Participation rights (standard)
- Information rights (standard)
- Registration rights (won't matter until IPO)
- Drag-along (standard)
- No-shop (standard)

**Focus your negotiation energy on the 5 that matter.**

💡 RECOMMENDATION:

Choose TERM SHEET A (Acme Seed Fund)
In a $30M exit, you make $0.2M more with Term Sheet A
```

**Key Insight:** The participating liquidation preference in Term Sheet B crushes you in small-to-medium exits. Only in exits above $50M does the higher valuation overcome the bad terms.

**Most companies exit between $10-50M. Term Sheet A is dramatically better.**

---

## Part 4: Red Flags—Deal Breakers

Some terms are so bad you should walk away.

### The 7 Red Flags

**1. 2× Participating Liquidation Preference**

**Why it's bad:** Investor gets 2× money back PLUS pro-rata. You get crushed in any exit under $50M.

**Response:** "We can't accept participating preferences. Standard market is 1× non-participating."

**2. Full Ratchet Anti-Dilution**

**Why it's bad:** If you ever raise a down round, founders get massively diluted.

**Response:** "Full ratchet is non-standard. We'll accept weighted average."

**3. Investor-Majority Board at Seed**

**Why it's bad:** You lose control of your company before you've even started.

**Response:** "At this stage, founders should maintain board control. We propose 2 founder seats, 1 investor seat."

**4. Pay-to-Play Provisions Applied to Founders**

**Why it's bad:** If you can't invest in future rounds, you lose equity. You're not an investor—you're building the company.

**Response:** "Pay-to-play should apply to investors, not founders."

**5. Excessive Protective Provisions**

**Why it's bad:** Investor can veto hiring, budgets, contracts—operational paralysis.

**Response:** "Protective provisions should cover major corporate actions only, not day-to-day operations."

**6. Redemption Rights**

**Why it's bad:** Investor can force you to buy back their shares after X years. If you don't have the cash, it triggers default.

**Response:** "Redemption rights aren't standard for venture deals. We can't accept them."

**7. Excessive Dividends or Interest**

**Why it's bad:** Startups don't generate cash for dividends. This is a debt-like term that drains the company.

**Response:** "Venture investments shouldn't have dividend requirements. That's a different asset class."

### When to Walk Away

**Walk away if:**
- Investor won't negotiate on 2× participating preference
- Investor demands full ratchet anti-dilution
- Investor demands majority board control at seed
- Investor adds redemption rights or dividends

**These terms can destroy your outcome even if the company succeeds.**

## Part 5: Negotiation Tactics

How do you negotiate when you're a first-time founder facing sophisticated VCs?

### Tactic 1: Leverage Multiple Term Sheets

**The setup:**
> "We have term sheets from both Acme and Vertex. We really like working with you, but Acme's terms are more founder-friendly (1× non-participating vs your 1× participating). Can you match their terms?"

**Why it works:** Creates competition. VCs hate losing deals to other VCs.

### Tactic 2: Use Market Standards

**The setup:**
> "Our lawyers say 1× participating isn't standard for seed rounds. We've looked at 10 recent seed term sheets and all are 1× non-participating. Can we align with market?"

**Why it works:** VCs don't want to look predatory. Pointing to "market standard" gives them cover.

### Tactic 3: Trade, Don't Cave

**The setup:**
> "We're willing to accept a 15% option pool if you'll move from participating to non-participating preference."

**Why it works:** Shows you're reasonable and willing to compromise, but you're trading value for value.

### Tactic 4: Bring in Your Lawyer

**The setup:**
> "Our attorney flagged the full ratchet anti-dilution as unusual. Can we move to weighted average?"

**Why it works:** Lets you play good cop/bad cop. "My lawyer won't let me accept this."

### Tactic 5: Focus on Investor Quality

**The setup:**
> "We're more excited about working with Acme because of their portfolio support and network. If you can match their terms, we'd love to work with you."

**Why it works:** Flatters the VC while making it clear terms matter.

### Tactic 6: Walk Away (If You Have To)

**The setup:**
> "We really appreciate the offer, but the terms don't work for us. We're going to pass. If your partnership reconsiders the participating preference, we'd be happy to revisit."

**Why it works:** Shows you have conviction. VCs respect founders who won't cave on bad terms. Often they'll come back with better terms.

### What NOT to Do

**Don't:**
- Accept the first offer without negotiation (they expect you to negotiate)
- Negotiate every term (pick your battles—focus on the 5 that matter)
- Get emotional or adversarial (stay professional)
- Lie about other offers (VCs talk to each other)
- Take forever to decide (they'll get impatient and move on)

---

## Part 6: The Closing Process

You've negotiated the term sheet. Now what?

### Timeline: 4-6 Weeks from Term Sheet to Wire

**Week 1: Sign Term Sheet**
- Review with lawyer (hire a startup lawyer, not your cousin)
- Negotiate final terms
- Sign (usually non-binding except no-shop clause)

**Week 2-3: Due Diligence**
- Investor requests documents (financials, cap table, contracts, IP)
- Reference checks (they'll call your customers, advisors, former colleagues)
- Technical review (if they have technical partners)
- Legal review (incorporation, IP ownership, employment agreements)

**Week 3-4: Definitive Documents**
- Stock Purchase Agreement (the actual legal contract)
- Investors' Rights Agreement (info rights, pro-rata, etc.)
- Right of First Refusal Agreement
- Voting Agreement (board composition)
- Certificate of Incorporation (amended to reflect new shares)

**Week 4-6: Closing**
- Sign definitive documents
- Board approves stock issuance
- File paperwork with state
- Wire transfer hits your account 🎉

### Documents You'll Need

**For due diligence:**
- Cap table (who owns what)
- Financial statements (last 12-24 months)
- Customer contracts (especially enterprise deals)
- IP assignment agreements (proof you own your code)
- Employment agreements (co-founders, employees)
- Board minutes and consents
- Tax returns

**Pro tip:** Set up a data room (Google Drive or DocSend) before you start fundraising. Speeds up diligence significantly.

### Common Diligence Issues

**1. IP Not Properly Assigned**
- **Problem:** Code written by contractors without IP assignment
- **Fix:** Get retroactive IP assignments signed before closing

**2. Co-founder Equity Not Vested**
- **Problem:** Co-founder has 50% equity but no vesting
- **Fix:** Implement vesting with buyback rights

**3. Verbal Contracts with Customers**
- **Problem:** No written agreements, just emails
- **Fix:** Get contracts signed retroactively

**4. Messy Cap Table**
- **Problem:** Multiple SAFE notes, unclear who owns what
- **Fix:** Clean up cap table, model SAFE conversions

---

## Part 7: Post-Close—Setting Up for Success

You've closed the round. The money is in the bank. Now what?

### Week 1: Celebrate, Then Get Back to Work

**Do:**
- Announce the raise (press release, social media)
- Thank everyone who helped (intros, advisors, customers)
- Celebrate with the team (but don't get too comfortable)

**Don't:**
- Go on vacation for 2 weeks
- Increase burn rate immediately
- Lose momentum

### Week 2-4: Investor Onboarding

**Set up board meetings:**
- Quarterly board meetings (for seed/Series A)
- Monthly if things are rocky
- Prepare board deck template (metrics, wins, challenges, asks)

**Set up investor updates:**
- Monthly email update (metrics, highlights, lowlights, asks)
- Keep investors informed so they can help

**Define working relationship:**
- How often will you talk? (Weekly? Monthly?)
- What do you need help with? (Hiring? Sales? Fundraising?)

### Ongoing: Managing Your Investors

**Good investor relations:**
- Be transparent (share both good and bad news)
- Ask for help (that's why they invested)
- Hit your milestones (trust is built by execution)
- Prepare them for future rounds (keep them warm on traction)

**Bad investor relations:**
- Go dark (no updates for months)
- Sugarcoat problems (they'll find out eventually)
- Miss milestones without explanation
- Surprise them with bad news

**Your investors are now your partners.** Treat them well, use them strategically, but remember: you're the CEO, you make the final decisions.

## Reflection Questions

1. **Why is liquidation preference more important than valuation in many scenarios?**

2. **Under what circumstances would you accept a participating liquidation preference?**

3. **How would you explain to a non-technical co-founder why Term Sheet A ($8M valuation, clean terms) is better than Term Sheet B ($12M valuation, bad terms)?**

4. **If you had to give up on one negotiation point to win on another, which would you prioritize?**

5. **At what point would you walk away from a term sheet, even if it's your only offer?**

6. **How do you balance "getting the best deal" vs "not pissing off your investor before the relationship even starts"?**

## From the Mentor: Don't Step Over Dollars to Pick Up Pennies

Here's what I wish I knew on my first fundraise:

**I optimized for valuation.** I took a $15M post-money term sheet over a $12M term sheet from a better investor. The higher-valuation deal had a participating preference. I didn't understand what that meant.

Three years later, we sold for $35M. I thought I'd make $25M (75% ownership). Instead, I made $18M. The participating preference cost me $7M.

**$7 million. Because I didn't understand one clause.**

Here's what I learned:

**1. Terms matter more than valuation.** A clean $8M deal beats a messy $12M deal 90% of the time.

**2. Most companies exit between $10-50M.** Not $100M+. Your liquidation preference matters a LOT in that range.

**3. Investor quality matters.** A great investor at $10M post is worth more than a mediocre investor at $12M post. The difference in value they add is massive.

**4. Negotiate, but don't be an asshole.** These people are going to be your partners for 5-10 years. Don't burn the relationship before it starts.

**5. Get a good lawyer.** Not your cousin who does real estate law. A startup lawyer who's seen 100+ term sheets.

I've now raised 4 rounds. I've negotiated better terms each time. The first round is the hardest because you don't know what you don't know.

**Now you know.** Use this knowledge. Get clean terms. Build a great company.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Liquidation preference is the most important term**—fight for 1× non-participating
2. **Terms matter more than valuation**—bad terms can wipe out valuation advantages
3. **Model different scenarios**—understand what you get in exits at $10M, $30M, $100M
4. **Know the red flags**—walk away from 2× participating, full ratchet, investor board control at seed
5. **Negotiate with leverage**—use multiple term sheets to get better terms
6. **Use market standards**—"This isn't standard for seed rounds" is powerful
7. **Focus on the 5 terms that matter**—don't waste energy on boilerplate
