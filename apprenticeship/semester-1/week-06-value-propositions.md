# Week 6: Value Propositions

**Semester 1: Markets, Problems & Value**
**Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours
**Mentor Voice**: Technical Founder/Startup CEO

## Opening: Why Most Value Props Fail

You've identified your ICP (Week 5). You know their problems (Week 4). You understand their psychology (Week 3).

Now: **How do you tell them why they should care?**

Most engineers write value propositions like this:

> "Bibby is a Spring Boot-based library management system with PostgreSQL backend, CLI interface, and barcode scanning capabilities."

**Nobody cares.**

Here's why that fails:
- **Features, not value**: "Spring Boot" means nothing to a librarian
- **Technical jargon**: "PostgreSQL backend" is irrelevant to the problem
- **No outcome**: What does the user GET from this?

**Compare to**:

> "Stop wasting 10 hours a week searching for lost books. Bibby finds any book in your library in under 10 seconds."

**This works because**:
- **Specific pain**: "10 hours a week searching"
- **Clear outcome**: "finds any book in under 10 seconds"
- **Measurable improvement**: 10 hours → 10 seconds

**Value propositions aren't about what you built. They're about what the customer gets.**

This week, you'll learn:
- How to articulate value in customer language
- The difference between features, benefits, and value
- How to position against competition
- How to test if your value prop resonates

## What Is a Value Proposition?

### The Definition

**Value Proposition** = A clear statement of the tangible results a customer gets from using your product

**Components**:
1. **Target segment**: Who is this for?
2. **Problem**: What pain do they have?
3. **Solution**: What do you offer?
4. **Differentiation**: Why choose you vs alternatives?
5. **Proof**: Why should they believe you?

---

### The Formula

```
For [target customer]
Who [statement of need or opportunity]
Our [product/service name]
Is a [product category]
That [statement of key benefit - compelling reason to buy]
Unlike [primary competitive alternative]
Our product [statement of primary differentiation]
```

---

**Bibby Example**:

```
For solo school librarians
Who waste 10+ hours per week manually tracking books
Bibby
Is a library management system
That automates cataloging, checkout, and overdue management
Unlike enterprise tools (too expensive and complex) or spreadsheets (too manual)
Bibby gives you the power of enterprise software at 1/20th the cost
with 1/10th the complexity
```

**Why this works**:
- Target: Specific (solo school librarians, not "librarians")
- Problem: Quantified (10+ hours/week)
- Category: Clear (library management system)
- Benefit: Concrete (automates specific tasks)
- Differentiation: Positioned against real alternatives
- Proof: Measurable claim (1/20th cost, 1/10th complexity)

---

**Industrial Example**:

```
For mid-market pipeline operators
Who react to equipment failures instead of preventing them
[Product Name]
Is a predictive maintenance platform
That predicts failures 2 weeks in advance using existing sensor data
Unlike full SCADA replacement (too expensive and risky) or manual inspections (too reactive)
Our product works alongside your legacy systems
and delivers ROI in 90 days
```

**Why this works**:
- Target: Specific operator segment
- Problem: Clear pain (reactive vs proactive)
- Category: Defined space (predictive maintenance)
- Benefit: Quantified (2 weeks advance notice)
- Differentiation: Works with, not against, legacy systems
- Proof: Concrete timeline (90 days to ROI)

## The Value Proposition Canvas

### Osterwalder's Framework

The Value Proposition Canvas has two sides:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         CUSTOMER PROFILE  |  VALUE MAP             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

   CUSTOMER JOBS              PRODUCTS & SERVICES
   (What they're              (What you offer)
    trying to do)
        │                           │
        ▼                           ▼
   CUSTOMER PAINS             PAIN RELIEVERS
   (Frustrations,             (How you reduce pain)
    obstacles, risks)
        │                           │
        ▼                           ▼
   CUSTOMER GAINS             GAIN CREATORS
   (Desired outcomes,         (How you create gains)
    benefits they want)
```

**The goal**: Your Value Map (right side) must fit the Customer Profile (left side) like a key in a lock.

---

### Building the Customer Profile (Left Side)

Start with **your ICP from Week 5**.

#### 1. Customer Jobs

**Jobs to be Done** (from Week 4):
- **Functional jobs**: Tasks they need to accomplish
- **Social jobs**: How they want to be perceived
- **Emotional jobs**: How they want to feel

**Bibby Example (Small School Librarian)**:

**Functional jobs**:
- Find requested books quickly
- Track which books are checked out
- Manage overdue books
- Do annual inventory
- Order new books within budget

**Social jobs**:
- Be seen as helpful and organized
- Get positive feedback from teachers
- Have a well-run, respected library

**Emotional jobs**:
- Feel in control (not overwhelmed)
- Feel like they're helping students
- Reduce daily stress and frustration

---

#### 2. Customer Pains

**Three types**:
- **Undesired outcomes**: Bad things that happen
- **Obstacles**: What prevents them from getting job done
- **Risks**: What could go wrong

**Bibby Example**:

**Undesired outcomes**:
- Books get lost ($500+/year cost)
- Students leave frustrated when can't find books
- Wastes 10+ hours/week on manual tracking

**Obstacles**:
- Excel spreadsheet gets out of sync with reality
- No easy way to see what's checked out
- Manual overdue process (teachers ignore emails)

**Risks**:
- Lose job if library is poorly managed
- Budget cut if can't show library value
- Audit fails if records are incomplete

---

#### 3. Customer Gains

**Three types**:
- **Required gains**: Minimum acceptable outcome
- **Expected gains**: What they hope for
- **Desired gains**: What would delight them

**Bibby Example**:

**Required gains**:
- Know which books exist in library
- Know which books are checked out
- Find books when students ask

**Expected gains**:
- Track books with minimal effort
- Reduce lost books to < 10/year
- Save 5+ hours/week on manual work

**Desired gains**:
- Data to justify book budget
- Recommendations on what books to buy
- Automatic overdue management
- Impress administration with organized library

---

### Building the Value Map (Right Side)

Now design your solution to fit the customer profile.

#### 1. Products & Services

**What you offer**:

**Bibby Example**:
- Book cataloging system
- Check-out/check-in tracking
- Barcode scanning
- Search functionality
- Overdue automation
- Usage reports
- Budget planning tools

---

#### 2. Pain Relievers

**How you address each pain**:

**Pain**: "Books get lost ($500+/year)"
**Pain Reliever**: "Track every checkout with automatic reminders, reduce lost books by 70%"

**Pain**: "Waste 10+ hours/week on manual tracking"
**Pain Reliever**: "Automate checkout/checkin, save 8 hours/week"

**Pain**: "Excel gets out of sync with reality"
**Pain Reliever**: "Real-time database, always accurate"

**Pain**: "Manual overdue process, teachers ignore emails"
**Pain Reliever**: "Automatic reminders, escalation to principal if 2 weeks overdue"

**Pain**: "Audit fails if records incomplete"
**Pain Reliever**: "Complete audit trail, compliance reporting with one click"

---

#### 3. Gain Creators

**How you create desired outcomes**:

**Gain**: "Save 5+ hours/week on manual work"
**Gain Creator**: "One-command checkout, automatic reporting"

**Gain**: "Data to justify book budget"
**Gain Creator**: "Checkout analytics show which books are popular, which genres are underserved"

**Gain**: "Recommendations on what books to buy"
**Gain Creator**: "AI-powered recommendations based on checkout patterns"

**Gain**: "Impress administration"
**Gain Creator**: "Professional reports, metrics showing library impact"

---

### The Fit

**Value Proposition = Where Value Map matches Customer Profile**

```
CUSTOMER PAIN              PAIN RELIEVER
"Waste 10 hours/week"  →  "Save 8 hours/week with automation"

CUSTOMER GAIN              GAIN CREATOR
"Know what to buy"     →  "Recommendations based on usage data"

CUSTOMER JOB               PRODUCT/SERVICE
"Find books quickly"   →  "10-second search across catalog"
```

**If your pain relievers don't address real pains, your value prop fails.**
**If your gain creators don't create desired gains, your value prop fails.**

---

## Feature vs Benefit vs Value

### The Hierarchy

Most engineers confuse these three levels:

```
FEATURE (What it is)
    ↓
BENEFIT (What it does)
    ↓
VALUE (What it means for customer)
```

**Example progression**:

**Feature**: "PostgreSQL database"
**Benefit**: "Fast, reliable data storage"
**Value**: "Never lose a book record, even if your computer crashes"

**Feature**: "Barcode scanning"
**Benefit**: "Add books in seconds"
**Value**: "Catalog your entire library in 1 afternoon instead of 1 week"

**Feature**: "RESTful API"
**Benefit**: "Integrates with other systems"
**Value**: "Connect to your school's student database, sync automatically"

---

### The "So What?" Test

For every feature, ask "So what?" until you reach customer value:

**Feature**: "Built with Spring Boot"
**So what?** → "Reliable, enterprise-grade foundation"
**So what?** → "System won't crash or lose data"
**So what?** → "You can trust it with your entire library catalog"
**So what?** → "No risk of losing years of cataloging work"

**That's the value.**

---

### Translating Bibby's Features to Value

From `BookCommands.java`, let's translate technical features to customer value:

#### Feature: Component Flow for Interactive CLI

**Technical**:
```java
ComponentFlow flow = componentFlowBuilder.clone()
    .withStringInput("title")
    .name("Book Title:_")
    .and().build();
```

**Engineer thinks**: "Clean, stateful UI using Spring Shell ComponentFlow"

**Customer hears**: "What?"

**Translation**:
- **Feature**: Interactive command-line flows
- **Benefit**: Step-by-step guidance, hard to make mistakes
- **Value**: "Add a book in 30 seconds, even if it's your first time using Bibby"

---

#### Feature: Shelf → Bookcase Hierarchy

**Technical**:
```java
Optional<ShelfEntity> shelfEntity = shelfService.findShelfById(bookEntity.getShelfId());
Optional<BookcaseEntity> bookcaseEntity = bookcaseService.findBookCaseById(shelfEntity.get().getBookcaseId());
```

**Engineer thinks**: "Proper relational data model with foreign keys"

**Customer hears**: "What?"

**Translation**:
- **Feature**: Hierarchical organization (Bookcase → Shelf → Book)
- **Benefit**: Mirrors your physical library structure
- **Value**: "Find any book by remembering 'It's in the History bookcase, top shelf' — just like you organize in real life"

---

#### Feature: Book Status Tracking

**Technical**:
```java
if (book.getBookStatus().equals("CHECKED_OUT"))
```

**Engineer thinks**: "Enum-based state management"

**Customer hears**: "What?"

**Translation**:
- **Feature**: Status tracking (Available, Checked Out, Reading, Lost)
- **Benefit**: Always know where books are
- **Value**: "Stop telling students 'I think we have that book' when you're not sure. Know for certain in 5 seconds."

---

### Exercise: Translate Your Features

For each major feature in Bibby (or your project):

1. **Feature** (What it is technically)
2. **Benefit** (What it enables)
3. **Value** (Why the customer cares)

**Format**:
```markdown
### Feature: [Technical name]

**Code reference**: [file:line]

**Technical description**:
[How it works]

**Benefit**:
[What it enables]

**Customer value**:
[Why they care - in their language]

**Quantified impact** (if possible):
[Saves X hours, prevents Y cost, increases Z metric]
```

---

## Competitive Positioning

### You're Not Competing in a Vacuum

Your value prop must position you against **real alternatives**.

**Alternatives fall into 4 categories**:

1. **Direct competitors**: Other products in your category
2. **Indirect competitors**: Different category, same job
3. **DIY**: Customer builds it themselves
4. **Do nothing**: Customer lives with the pain

**Most founders only think about #1. Winners compete against all four.**

---

### The Positioning Map

```
                    HIGH PRICE
                        ↑
                        │

**Bibby's Positioning**:

```
                 EXPENSIVE ($2K+/year)
                        ↑
                        │

                    │   ($50/mo)     │   (Free)
                        │            │
                        ↓
                 INEXPENSIVE (Free-$100/mo)
```

**Positioning statement**:
> "Enterprise power at spreadsheet simplicity and 1/20th the cost"

**This tells customers**:
- We're better than spreadsheets (more powerful)
- We're better than enterprise (simpler, cheaper)
- We occupy the sweet spot in the middle

---

### Differentiation Strategies

**How do you stand out?**

#### 1. Feature Differentiation

**What you have that competitors don't**:

**Bibby example**:
- "Only library system with CLI-first design (for power users)"
- "Only system with AI-powered book recommendations"
- "Only system that imports from Excel in one click"

**Industrial example**:
- "Only predictive maintenance that works with legacy SCADA"
- "Only system certified for hazardous environments"
- "Only platform with 2-week failure prediction accuracy"

---

#### 2. Experience Differentiation

**How it feels to use you vs competitors**:

**Bibby example**:
- "Set up in 30 minutes vs 3 days" (enterprise competitors)
- "Librarian personality, not robotic" (CLI has character)
- "Learn in 1 hour vs 1 week of training"

**Industrial example**:
- "Mobile-first for operators on the floor" (vs desktop-only legacy)
- "Real-time alerts to phone" (vs email reports no one reads)
- "One-tap status updates" (vs 10-field forms)

---

#### 3. Price Differentiation

**Different value for the price**:

**Bibby example**:
- "$50/month vs $2,000/year" (vs enterprise)
- "Pays for itself in 2 weeks" (time saved)
- "ROI: 1,000%" (quantified value)

**Industrial example**:
- "$2K/month vs $200K upfront" (opex vs capex)
- "90-day ROI guarantee"
- "Price per prevented failure, not per sensor"

---

#### 4. Service Differentiation

**How you support customers**:

**Bibby example**:
- "Free migration service" (we import your Excel)
- "24-hour email support" (vs "submit a ticket")
- "30-day money-back, keep your data"

**Industrial example**:
- "24/7 on-call for safety-critical alerts"
- "Free pilot installation (no commitment)"
- "Dedicated integration engineer"

---

### The Comparison Table

Create a feature/value comparison:

| Feature | Bibby | Enterprise Tools | Spreadsheets |
|---------|-------|------------------|--------------|
| Setup time | 30 min | 3 days | Immediate |
| Monthly cost | $50 | $200+ | Free |
| Book capacity | 50,000 | Unlimited | Limited |
| Checkout tracking | ✅ Automatic | ✅ Complex | ❌ Manual |
| Overdue automation | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Multi-branch | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Complex |
| Barcode scanning | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Reports | ✅ Yes | ✅ Advanced | ⚠️ Manual |
| Learning curve | 1 hour | 1 week | Immediate |
| Support | Email | Phone/Email | None |

**Use this to show**:
- Where you win (✅ vs their ❌)
- Where you intentionally lose (❌ because ICP doesn't need it)
- Where you're "good enough" (⚠️ but cheaper/simpler)

---

## Crafting Compelling Value Statements

### The One-Sentence Value Prop

**Format**:

> [Product] helps [target customer] [achieve outcome] by [unique approach]

**Bibby examples**:

**Generic** (weak):
> "Bibby helps librarians manage books"

**Specific** (strong):
> "Bibby helps solo school librarians find any book in 10 seconds by automating catalog search and tracking"

**Even better** (quantified value):
> "Bibby gives solo school librarians 8 hours back per week by automating book tracking and overdue management"

---

**Industrial examples**:

**Generic** (weak):
> "PipelineAI helps operators monitor equipment"

**Specific** (strong):
> "PipelineAI helps mid-market pipeline operators prevent failures by predicting equipment issues 2 weeks in advance"

**Even better** (quantified value):
> "PipelineAI saves mid-market operators $150K/year by preventing unplanned outages through ML-based predictive maintenance"

---

### The Three-Bullet Value Prop

**Format**:

**Headline**: One-sentence value prop

**Bullets**:
1. **Solve specific pain**: [What painful problem you eliminate]
2. **Create specific gain**: [What positive outcome you enable]
3. **Differentiate**: [Why you vs alternatives]

---

**Bibby example**:

**Headline**:
"Get 8 hours back every week with automated library management"

**Bullets**:
1. **Stop wasting time searching**: Find any book in 10 seconds, even if mis-shelved
2. **Stop losing books**: Track every checkout, reduce lost books by 70%
3. **Skip the enterprise complexity**: Setup in 30 minutes, not 3 days — at 1/20th the cost

---

**Industrial example**:

**Headline**:
"Prevent $150K in unplanned downtime with 2-week advance failure predictions"

**Bullets**:
1. **Stop reacting to failures**: Predict equipment issues before they cause outages
2. **Extend equipment life**: Schedule maintenance optimally, reduce over-maintenance waste
3. **Works with legacy systems**: No rip-and-replace — integrates with your existing SCADA

---

### The Landing Page Formula

**Structure**:

1. **Hero Section**:
   - Headline (one-sentence value prop)
   - Sub-headline (elaborates, adds specificity)
   - CTA (what to do next)
   - Visual (screenshot, demo, diagram)

2. **Problem Section**:
   - Call out the pain
   - Show you understand their world
   - Quantify the cost

3. **Solution Section**:
   - How you solve it
   - Key features (translated to benefits)
   - Visual proof (screenshots, demo video)

4. **Differentiation Section**:
   - Why you vs alternatives
   - Comparison table
   - Unique advantages

5. **Proof Section**:
   - Testimonials
   - Case studies
   - Metrics (users, books cataloged, time saved)

6. **CTA Section**:
   - Clear next step
   - Remove friction (free trial, no credit card)
   - Risk reversal (money-back guarantee)

---

**Bibby landing page outline**:

**Hero**:
- Headline: "Stop wasting 10 hours a week searching for lost books"
- Sub: "Bibby gives solo school librarians automated library management at 1/20th the cost of enterprise tools"
- CTA: "Start free 30-day trial"
- Visual: Screenshot of search + checkout flow

**Problem**:
> "You became a librarian to help students discover books. Instead, you spend 10+ hours a week manually tracking books in Excel, searching for mis-shelved books, and chasing overdue reminders. Lost books cost your school $500+/year. And administrators have no visibility into library impact."

**Solution**:
- Automatic cataloging (add books in seconds)
- Instant search (find any book in 10 seconds)
- Checkout tracking (know who has what)
- Overdue automation (stop manual reminders)
- Usage reports (show your impact)

**Differentiation**:
| Feature | Bibby | Enterprise | Spreadsheets |
| Setup | 30 min | 3 days | Immediate |
| Cost | $50/mo | $200+/mo | Free |
| Ease | Learn in 1 hour | 1 week training | Know already |

**Proof**:
> "I got 3 hours back every week. My principal was impressed with the usage reports I generated in 5 minutes." — Katie R., Madison Elementary

> "127 school libraries • 450,000+ books cataloged • 50,000+ checkouts tracked"

**CTA**:
> "Start your free 30-day trial. Import your Excel catalog in 5 minutes. No credit card required."

---

## Testing Your Value Prop

### Does It Resonate?

**Good value props make customers say**:
- "This is exactly my problem"
- "I need this"
- "How much does it cost?"
- "When can I start?"

**Bad value props make customers say**:
- "Interesting..." (polite dismissal)
- "Let me think about it" (not urgent)
- "Send me more info" (not convinced)

---

### The 5-Second Test

**Method**:
1. Show your value prop to someone in your ICP
2. Let them read for 5 seconds
3. Hide it
4. Ask: "What did the product do?"

**If they can't explain it, your value prop fails.**

---

### The Mom Test (Applied to Value Props)

**Don't ask**:
- "Do you like this?" (They'll say yes to be polite)
- "Would you buy this?" (Hypothetical, not real)
- "Is this clear?" (They'll say yes even if confused)

**Do ask**:
- "What problem does this solve?"
- "How does this compare to what you use now?"
- "If this existed today, what would you do?"
- "What's missing that would make you buy?"

---

### A/B Testing Value Props

**Test different angles**:

**Angle 1: Time Savings**
> "Get 8 hours back every week"

**Angle 2: Cost Savings**
> "Stop losing $500/year in lost books"

**Angle 3: Emotional**
> "Spend time helping students, not searching for books"

**Angle 4: Status**
> "Impress your principal with professional library reports"

**Measure**:
- Which gets more clicks?
- Which gets more trial signups?
- Which converts to paid?

**Different segments respond to different angles.**

---

1. Hero section (headline, sub-headline, CTA, visual)
2. Problem section (pain callout, quantified cost)
3. Solution section (how it works, key features)
4. Differentiation section (vs alternatives)
5. Proof section (testimonials, metrics, case studies)
6. CTA section (next step, risk reversal)

**Deliverable**: Complete landing page outline (1,500 words)

---

## Code Integration: Value Prop in UX

Your value proposition should be evident in every user interaction.

### From `BookCommands.java:89-127` — The Add Book Flow

```java
@Command(command = "add", description = "Add a new book to your library database")
public void addBook() throws InterruptedException {
    // ... flow logic ...

    Thread.sleep(1000);
    System.out.println("\n\u001B[36m</>\033[0m: Ah, a brand-new book...");
    Thread.sleep(1750);
    System.out.printf("\u001B[36m</>\033[0m:'%s', right?",title);
    Thread.sleep(2350);
    System.out.println("\n\u001B[36m</>\033[0m: I'll handle adding it to the database and prepare it for the library.");
    Thread.sleep(3800);
    System.out.println("\n\u001B[36m</>\033[0m: Should I recommend where it belongs?\n");
}
```

**Current value prop** (implicit): "Friendly cataloging"

**Could be stronger**:

```java
@Command(command = "add", description = "Catalog a book in 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes")
public void addBook() throws InterruptedException {
    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

    // ... flow logic ...

    long elapsed = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;

    System.out.println("\n✅ Book cataloged in " + (elapsed/1000) + " seconds!");
    System.out.println("📊 That's 4 minutes faster than manual entry");
    System.out.println("💰 You've saved " + ((elapsed/1000)/60.0 * 25) + " dollars in labor time");

    // Show cumulative value
    long totalBooksSaved = bookService.count();
    long totalTimeSaved = totalBooksSaved * 270; // 4.5 minutes per book in seconds
    System.out.println("\n📈 Lifetime savings: " + (totalTimeSaved/3600) + " hours across " + totalBooksSaved + " books");
}
```

**Why this is better**:
- Reinforces value prop ("30 seconds instead of 5 minutes")
- Quantifies time saved (measurable)
- Shows cumulative impact (builds over time)
- Customer sees ROI with every action

### Value Prop in Error Messages

**Bad error**:
```
Error: Book not found
```

**Good error** (reinforces value):
```
🔍 Book not found in your catalog.

This usually means:
• Book hasn't been added yet → Add it in 30 seconds: bibby book add
• Typo in search → Try: bibby book search (with fuzzy matching)
• Book was removed → Check removed books: bibby book list --removed

Need help? support@bibby.com
```

**Why this is better**:
- Helpful (solves the problem)
- Educational (teaches features)
- Reinforces value prop ("30 seconds to add")
- Shows you care (not just technical errors)

## Reflection Questions

Spend 30-45 minutes journaling:

1. **Look at Bibby's current features.** If you showed the code to a librarian, would they understand the value? How would you translate technical decisions into customer outcomes?

2. **Think about software you use daily.** What's their value prop to you? Is it clear? Do they deliver on it? What could they improve?

3. **Your resume/LinkedIn probably lists technical skills** (Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL). How would you rewrite it as value props? ("I build X that helps Y achieve Z")

4. **In your industrial experience**, how did vendors sell you software? Did they lead with features or value? Which was more compelling?

5. **Engineers often undersell their work.** Why? Is it humility? Lack of business thinking? Fear of seeming salesy? How does understanding value props change this?

## Interview Talking Points

### For Product Roles:

**Q: "How do you communicate product value to customers?"**

**Framework**:
1. "I start by deeply understanding customer jobs, pains, and gains — using the Value Proposition Canvas"
2. "I translate technical features into customer outcomes using the feature-benefit-value hierarchy"
3. "I position against real alternatives: direct competitors, DIY, and do-nothing"
4. "I test value props with 5-second tests and customer interviews, not assumptions"
5. "Example: With Bibby, I could say 'PostgreSQL backend,' but I say 'Never lose a book record, even if your computer crashes' — same feature, customer language"

---

### For Engineering Roles:

**Q: "Walk me through a technical decision and its business impact."**

**Framework**:
1. "I chose [technology/architecture] for [technical reason]"
2. "This enabled [capability]"
3. "Which let users [specific action]"
4. "Creating [measurable value]"
5. "Example: I used Spring Shell ComponentFlow for Bibby's CLI. This creates stateful, guided workflows (technical benefit) which means users can add books in 30 seconds with no training (customer benefit), saving 4.5 minutes per book or ~$100/month in labor for a typical school library (business value)"

**This shows**: You connect technical decisions to business outcomes.

- **How** to communicate value (Week 6: This week)

Next: **How big is the opportunity?**

We'll cover:
- Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
- Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
- Top-down vs bottom-up sizing
- Sanity checking market assumptions

**Preparation**:
Start researching:
- How many potential customers exist in your ICP?
- What do they currently spend on solutions?
- What could the market be worth?

## Weekly Summary

This week, you learned:

✅ **Value propositions articulate outcomes, not features** — Customers care about results
✅ **Value Proposition Canvas** — Systematic framework for matching value to customer needs
✅ **Feature → Benefit → Value** — Three-level translation to customer language
✅ **Competitive positioning** — You compete against direct, indirect, DIY, and do-nothing
✅ **Differentiation strategies** — Feature, experience, price, service
✅ **Testing value props** — 5-second test, Mom Test, A/B testing
✅ **Value in UX** — Every interaction should reinforce your value proposition

**Key Mindset Shift**: Stop talking about what you built. Start talking about what customers get.

## Mentor Sign-Off

**From the Technical Founder:**

Here's what I learned building three startups:

**Engineers fall in love with their code. Founders fall in love with customer outcomes.**

The difference?

- Engineers say: "I built this cool CLI with Spring Shell ComponentFlow"
- Founders say: "I save librarians 8 hours a week so they can help students"

**Same product. Different language.**

Your value prop isn't about you. It's about them:
- Their problem
- Their outcome
- Their language
- Their value

You now know how to:
- Map customer needs (Canvas)
- Translate features to value
- Position against alternatives
- Test if it resonates

Next week: How do you know if the opportunity is big enough to build a business?

See you then.
