## How to Use This Program

1. **Read each section thoroughly** - Don't rush. Each section is 1,500-2,500 words of dense, practical content.

2. **Complete the Action Items** - Every section ends with specific tasks. These are crucial for learning.

3. **Take notes and ask questions** - When something is unclear, write it down and ask.

4. **Apply to your code immediately** - This isn't theoretical. We're transforming Bibby together.

5. **Review before moving on** - Make sure you understand each section before proceeding to the next.

1. **Understand DDD deeply**
   - Model domains using entities, value objects, and aggregates
   - Implement rich domain models (not anemic ones)
   - Design bounded contexts and anti-corruption layers
   - Use domain events for decoupling

2. **Master Gang of Four Design Patterns**
   - Know when and how to apply 15+ classic patterns
   - Recognize anti-patterns and avoid them
   - Refactor procedural code to pattern-based design
   - Understand trade-offs of each pattern

3. **Embody Pragmatic Programmer Principles**
   - Write DRY, orthogonal code
   - Use tracer bullets and prototypes effectively
   - Debug systematically and defensively
   - Think critically about your code

4. **Achieve Testing Mastery**
   - Write effective unit, integration, and E2E tests
   - Use mocking appropriately (not excessively)
   - Practice TDD for new features
   - Achieve and maintain 80%+ code coverage

5. **Become a Senior-Level Engineer**
   - Think architecturally, not just tactically
   - Communicate technical decisions clearly
   - Write code that's maintainable and expressive
   - Understand when to apply (and not apply) patterns

## Notes from Your Mentor

This journey will take approximately **12 weeks** if you dedicate 8-12 hours per week. That's realistic for someone working full-time or in school.

Some sections will challenge you. Some will feel like overkill. Some will make everything click. That's the learning process.

The goal isn't perfection - it's **continuous improvement**. Each section makes you a better engineer than you were before.

I'm proud of you for committing to this. Let's build something great together.
