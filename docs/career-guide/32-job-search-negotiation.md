# Section 32: Job Search & Negotiation

**Part V: Interview Mastery — Week 32**

**Overview:**
You've mastered technical interviews (Section 29), system design (Section 30), and behavioral interviews (Section 31). You've built your network (Sections 25-28) and your public presence (Sections 17-24). Now it's time to execute the job search, navigate the interview process, negotiate offers, and land your target backend engineering role.

**What This Section Covers:**
This is the **final section** - the culmination of 32 weeks of preparation. You'll learn how to strategically apply to jobs, manage multiple interview processes, negotiate compensation, and make the final decision.

**Why This Matters:**
- **All preparation means nothing without execution:** You've built the skills, now you need to convert them into offers
- **Job search is a numbers game with strategy:** Quality applications to right companies > spray-and-pray
- **Negotiation is expected:** Not negotiating leaves $10K-$30K on the table
- **First backend role sets career trajectory:** Choose wisely based on learning, growth, and compensation

**Week 32 Goals:**
1. Finalize resume and application materials
2. Build job search tracking system
3. Understand interview process timeline and expectations
4. Learn offer negotiation tactics and strategies
5. Know how to evaluate and compare multiple offers
6. Prepare for first 90 days at new role
7. **Execute and land the job**

**Time Commitment:** 15-20 hours (Week 32) + ongoing until you accept offer

- LinkedIn is optimized and active (Section 26 ✓)

**Start applying NOW. Week 32 is execution week.**

### Application Channels (Ranked by Success Rate)

**Channel 1: Referrals (Highest Success Rate: 30-50%)**

**From your networking (Sections 25-28):**
- Informational interviews → referrals
- Event connections → referrals
- Community members → referrals
- LinkedIn connections → referrals

**How to ask for referral (if you haven't already):**
```
Subject: Backend Engineer role at [Company] - would you be comfortable referring me?

Hi [Name],

I saw [Company] posted a Backend Engineer position ([link to job posting]), and based on
our conversation [X weeks ago], it seems like a great fit for my background.

Since we last talked, I've [update on progress - completed technical interview prep,
published article, etc.]. I'm really excited about the possibility of working at [Company],
especially [specific reason based on your conversation].

Would you be comfortable referring me for this position? I'm happy to send you my resume
tailored to the role and any additional information that would be helpful.

I know employee referrals are a big ask, so no pressure at all if you'd prefer to wait
until we've had more chances to connect.

Either way, thanks for all your help so far!

Best,
Leo
```

**Expected timeline:**
- Week 32: Request 3-5 referrals for open positions
- Week 33-34: Referrals submitted, recruiter screens begin
- Week 35-38: Interview loops
- Week 39-40: Offers

**Channel 2: Direct Application via Company Career Page (Medium Success Rate: 5-10%)**

**When to use:**
- Company doesn't have anyone in your network (yet)
- You've researched company and know you're good fit
- Job posting matches your skills closely

**How to optimize:**
- Tailor resume to job description
- Use keywords from posting
- Apply within first 48 hours of posting (highest visibility)
- Follow up with hiring manager on LinkedIn after 1 week

**Channel 3: LinkedIn Easy Apply (Low Success Rate: 2-5%)**

**When to use:**
- Quick way to get resume in front of more companies
- Use for "backup" companies (not top choices)

**Don't rely on this exclusively** - supplement with referrals and direct applications.

**Channel 4: Recruiters (Variable Success Rate: 10-20%)**

**Two types:**

**Company Recruiters (Internal):**
- Reach out if they contact you
- Often better quality matches
- Direct line to hiring manager

**Third-Party Recruiters (External):**
- Can be helpful for contract-to-hire or hard-to-fill roles
- Quality varies widely
- Be selective about which recruiters you work with

**Channel 5: Job Boards (Low Success Rate: 2-5%)**

**Use as research tool:**
- Indeed, Glassdoor, Dice, BuiltIn
- Understand market (salary ranges, skills in demand)
- Find companies you didn't know were hiring
- **Then apply via referral or direct** (not through job board)

---

### Target Company Strategy

**From Section 25, your target list:**

**Tier 1: Primary Targets (5-7 companies)**
- OSIsoft, Uptake, Rockwell Automation, Honeywell, Aveva
- **Action:** Referral applications only (network first if needed)
- **Goal:** 2-3 offers from this tier

**Tier 2: Secondary Targets (5-8 companies)**
- Splunk, Datadog, PagerDuty, HashiCorp, Grafana, Redis Labs, etc.
- **Action:** Mix of referrals and direct applications
- **Goal:** 2-4 offers from this tier

**Tier 3: Backup/Practice (10-15 companies)**
- Other backend engineering roles at solid companies
- **Action:** Direct applications, LinkedIn Easy Apply
- **Goal:** Interview practice, potential offers

**Week 32 Application Goals:**
- **5-7 referral applications** (Tier 1 + top Tier 2)
- **8-10 direct applications** (Tier 2 + Tier 3)
- **10-15 LinkedIn Easy Apply** (Tier 3, quick applications)

**Total: 23-32 applications in Week 32**

**Why this many?**
- Referral conversion: 30-50% → 2-4 interviews
- Direct application: 5-10% → 1-2 interviews
- Easy Apply: 2-5% → 0-1 interviews
- **Total: 3-7 interviews** (goal is 5-8 to have multiple offers)

**Month 2-3:** Continue applying 10-15/week until you have 3+ active interview processes

---

## Part 2: Resume Optimization

### Resume Structure for Backend Engineering

### ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Optimization

**What is ATS?**
Software that scans resumes for keywords before human sees them.

**How to optimize:**

**1. Use keywords from job description:**
If posting says "Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker" → your resume should include these exact terms

**2. Use standard section headings:**
- "Experience" (not "Work History")
- "Education" (not "Academic Background")
- "Skills" (not "Technical Competencies")

**3. Avoid:**
- Tables (ATS can't parse)
- Images or graphics
- Fancy fonts
- Headers/footers
- Multiple columns (use single column)

**4. Use .docx or .pdf format:**
- PDF preferred (preserves formatting)
- .docx also works well
- Avoid .pages or other formats

**5. Include exact job title:**
If applying for "Backend Engineer," use "Backend Engineer" in your summary/header (not "Software Engineer" or "Full-Stack Developer")

### Tailoring Resume for Each Application

**Don't send same resume to every company.**

**For each application:**

**1. Adjust Summary (30 seconds):**
```
Generic:
"Backend engineer with operational experience..."

For OSIsoft:
"Backend engineer with 5 years using OSIsoft PI System in production,
now building the industrial software I used to operate..."

For Datadog:
"Backend engineer with 9 years monitoring critical infrastructure,
bringing operational empathy to building observability tools..."
```

**2. Adjust Skills ordering (15 seconds):**
If job posting emphasizes Redis → move Redis to top of database list

**3. Adjust project description (1 minute):**
Emphasize aspects relevant to company
- For industrial software company: Mention reliability, uptime, real-time
- For observability company: Mention monitoring, metrics, alerting

**4. Adjust experience bullets (2 minutes):**
Reorder bullets to put most relevant ones first

**Total time per tailored resume: 5 minutes**
**Worth it for Tier 1 and top Tier 2 companies**

## Part 3: Job Search Tracking System

### The Spreadsheet

**Columns to track:**

| Company | Role | Tier | Applied Date | Source | Status | Next Step | Last Updated | Notes |
|---------|------|------|--------------|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| OSIsoft | Backend Eng | 1 | 3/15 | Referral (Sarah) | Phone Screen Scheduled | Prep for 3/22 call | 3/18 | Sarah referred me, hiring manager is Mike |
| Uptake | Sr Backend | 1 | 3/16 | Direct | Application Submitted | Follow up 3/23 | 3/16 | Applied via careers page |
| Datadog | Backend SWE | 2 | 3/17 | LinkedIn | Recruiter Response | Schedule screen | 3/19 | Recruiter reached out same day |

**Status values:**
- Application Submitted
- Recruiter Screen Scheduled
- Recruiter Screen Complete
- Phone Technical Scheduled
- Phone Technical Complete
- Onsite/Final Loop Scheduled
- Onsite/Final Loop Complete
- Offer Received
- Offer Accepted
- Rejected

**Why track:**
- See pipeline at a glance
- Know when to follow up
- Don't lose track of opportunities
- Data for decision-making

### Interview Process Timeline (Typical)

**Week 1-2: Application → Recruiter Screen**
- Submit application
- Wait 3-7 days for recruiter response (referrals faster: 1-3 days)
- Recruiter screen (30 min phone call)

**Week 3: Technical Phone Screen**
- 1 week after recruiter screen
- 45-60 min coding interview (Section 29 prep)
- Sometimes combined with system design for senior roles

**Week 4-5: Onsite/Final Loop**
- 1-2 weeks after phone screen
- 3-5 rounds:
  - Technical coding (1-2 rounds)
  - System design (1 round)
  - Behavioral (1 round)
  - Hiring manager (1 round)
- Usually 1 day (4-6 hours) virtual or in-person

**Week 6: Offer Decision**
- 3-7 days after onsite
- Offer or rejection
- Negotiation (if offer)
- Decision deadline (typically 1 week)

**Total: 6-8 weeks from application to offer**

**Managing Multiple Processes:**

**Goal: Have 3-5 companies at final rounds simultaneously**

**Strategy:**
- Apply in batches (Week 32: 25-30 applications)
- Some companies move faster than others (natural staggering)
- If company A moves too fast: "I'm excited about this opportunity. I have a few other processes wrapping up in the next 2 weeks. Could we schedule the onsite for [date 2 weeks out]?"
- If company B moves too slow: "I'm very interested in [Company B]. I wanted to let you know I have another offer with a deadline of [date]. Is there any way to expedite the process?"

**You have more control than you think.** Companies want good candidates and will work with reasonable timeline requests.

---

## Part 4: The Interview Process

### Recruiter Screen (30 minutes)

**Purpose:** Verify basic qualifications, culture fit, interest level

**Questions they'll ask:**
- Tell me about your background
- Why are you interested in this role/company?
- What are you looking for in your next role?
- What's your expected salary range?
- When could you start?
- Do you have other offers/interviews?

**How to prepare:**

**1. Research company (30 min before call):**
- Recent news (funding, product launches)
- Engineering blog (recent posts)
- Glassdoor reviews

**2. Prepare your story (60 seconds):**
"I spent 9 years in pipeline operations managing SCADA systems. I built strong foundations
in systems thinking and reliability, but I wanted to transition from operating software to
building it. I completed a CS degree while working full-time, attended a bootcamp, and built
Bibby - a Spring Boot library management system. I'm now looking for a backend engineering
role where my operational background adds value. [Company] is perfect because [specific reason]."

**3. Prepare 2-3 questions:**
- "What does the team structure look like?"
- "What would my first project likely be?"
- "What's the interview process and timeline?"

**Salary question:**

**Don't give number first if possible:**
```
Recruiter: "What's your expected salary range?"

You: "I'm flexible on compensation and more focused on finding the right role and team.
What's the budgeted range for this position?"

If they push: "Based on my research for backend engineers with my background in [city],
I'm seeing ranges of $90K-$120K. Does this role fall within that range?"
```

**Research salary using:**
- Levels.fyi (most accurate for tech)
- Glassdoor (okay, often outdated)
- LinkedIn Salary Insights
- H1B database (public data for sponsored positions)

**Other offers question:**

**If you have other processes:**
"I'm in conversations with a few other companies (I don't have any offers yet), but [Company]
is definitely a top choice because [specific reason]."

**If you don't:**
"I'm early in my search and talking to a few companies. I'm being selective and focusing on
backend roles at [industrial software / observability / etc.] companies."

**Outcome:**
- Pass: Advance to technical phone screen (scheduled within 1 week)
- Fail: "We'll be in touch" (usually means rejection)

---

### Technical Phone Screen (45-60 minutes)

**Covered in Section 29.** This is 1-2 LeetCode-style problems.

**Typical difficulty:** 1 medium or 2 easy-medium

**Your preparation:**
- Week 29 practice (10-15 problems)
- 2-3 mock interviews
- UMPIRE framework

**What to do night before:**
- Review 2-3 favorite problems (confidence boost)
- Don't grind new problems (you're ready)
- Get good sleep

**Day of:**
- Test technology (CoderPad, HackerRank, Zoom)
- Have notebook and pen ready
- Review UMPIRE framework
- 10 deep breaths before call

**Outcome:**
- Pass: Advance to onsite/final loop
- Borderline: Sometimes second phone screen
- Fail: Rejection (typically you can reapply in 6-12 months)

---

### Onsite/Final Loop (4-6 hours)

**Typical structure for backend role:**

**Round 1: Technical Coding (60 min)**
- 1-2 problems (similar to phone screen but slightly harder)
- Section 29 prep applies

**Round 2: System Design (60 min)**
- Design a system (URL shortener, rate limiter, etc.)
- Section 30 prep applies
- **This is where you shine** (operational background advantage)

**Round 3: Behavioral (45 min)**
- STAR stories, culture fit
- Section 31 prep applies

**Round 4: Technical Coding #2 or Domain-Specific (60 min)**
- Sometimes second coding round
- Sometimes domain-specific (e.g., for industrial software company, might discuss SCADA, time-series data)

**Round 5: Hiring Manager (30-45 min)**
- Mix of behavioral and culture fit
- Opportunity to ask about team, roadmap, growth

**Between rounds:**
- Usually 5-10 min breaks
- Use bathroom, drink water, take notes
- Stay energized (bring snacks)

**Virtual vs In-Person:**

**Virtual:**
- More common post-COVID
- Easier logistically (no travel)
- Same structure, just on Zoom

**In-Person:**
- Some companies still prefer this
- Shows you're serious
- Opportunity to see office culture
- Company usually pays for travel

**After Onsite:**

**Send thank-you emails (within 24 hours):**

```

## Part 5: Offer Negotiation

### When You Get the Offer

**Recruiter will call or email:**
"We'd like to extend an offer for the Backend Engineer role. The offer includes..."

**Your response:**

**Step 1: Express enthusiasm (30 seconds)**
"That's fantastic news! I'm really excited about this opportunity and the conversations
I've had with the team."

**Step 2: Ask for details in writing (30 seconds)**
"Can you send me the full offer details in writing so I can review everything carefully?
I want to make sure I understand the full package."

**Step 3: Ask for time (30 seconds)**
"When do you need a decision by?"

**Typical deadline: 1 week** (you can often extend to 2 weeks if you have other processes)

**Step 4: DO NOT accept immediately**
"Let me review the offer details and get back to you by [date]. Thank you again!"

**Even if it's your dream job at dream salary, DO NOT accept on the spot.** Always negotiate.

### Understanding the Offer Package

**Components:**

**1. Base Salary**
- Fixed annual salary
- Paid bi-weekly or monthly
- Most important for junior/mid-level roles

**2. Equity/Stock (if applicable)**
- Startup: Stock options (ISOs or NSOs)
- Public company: RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)
- Vesting schedule (typically 4 years with 1-year cliff)
- **Value is uncertain** (especially for private companies)

**3. Bonus**
- Performance bonus (typically 10-20% of base for backend engineers)
- Sign-on bonus (one-time payment, often to offset equity you're leaving)
- **Not guaranteed** (depends on performance and company performance)

**4. Benefits**
- Health insurance (medical, dental, vision)
- 401(k) matching
- PTO (Paid Time Off) - typically 2-4 weeks
- Remote work policy
- Learning budget
- Hardware (laptop, monitor, etc.)

**Example Offer:**

```
Backend Engineer - Uptake

Base Salary: $105,000
Sign-on Bonus: $10,000
Performance Bonus: 10% target ($10,500)
Equity: 5,000 stock options, 4-year vest with 1-year cliff
Benefits: Health insurance, 15 days PTO, 401(k) 4% match, $1,500 learning budget
Start Date: May 1, 2024

Total first-year compensation: $105K + $10K sign-on + $10.5K bonus = $125,500
(excluding equity value which is uncertain)
```

### How to Negotiate

**Negotiation is EXPECTED in tech. Companies build buffer into initial offers.**

**What you can negotiate (ranked by success rate):**

**1. Base Salary (80% success rate)**
- Most common and straightforward
- Usually 5-15% increase possible

**2. Sign-on Bonus (70% success rate)**
- Easier for companies to approve (one-time cost)
- Often used to bridge gap if base is at max

**3. Equity (50% success rate)**
- More negotiable at startups than public companies
- Worth trying

**4. Start Date (90% success rate)**
- Almost always negotiable
- Gives you time to wrap up current job, relax

**5. Remote Work / Flexibility (60% success rate)**
- Increasingly negotiable post-COVID
- "Remote 2 days/week" → "Remote 3 days/week"

**6. PTO (30% success rate)**
- Harder to negotiate (policy-based)
- More success at smaller companies

**What you CANNOT negotiate:**
- Benefits (health insurance, 401k match) - these are company-wide policies
- Title (usually fixed for level)

### Negotiation Script

**Step 1: Do your research (1-2 hours)**

**Use:**
- Levels.fyi - filter by company, role, location, years of experience
- Glassdoor salary reports
- Ask your network ("What's typical for backend engineer with 1 year exp at [Company]?")

**Find the range for:**
- Backend Engineer (or Software Engineer II, etc.)
- Your location (adjust for cost of living)
- Your experience level (you have 0 years software engineering, but 9 years professional experience)

**Example research:**

```
Backend Engineer in [Your City]:
- Junior (0-2 years): $85K-$105K
- Mid-level (3-5 years): $105K-$135K

Your positioning: Junior level (0 software eng exp) but strong transferable experience
→ Target: High end of junior range ($100K-$110K) or low end of mid-level

Uptake initial offer: $105K → This is mid-range for junior
→ Room to negotiate to $110K-$115K
```

**Step 2: Determine your ask**

**Formula:**
Initial offer + 10-15% = Your ask
(They'll likely meet you halfway)

**Example:**
- Offer: $105K base
- Your ask: $115K base (9.5% increase)
- Likely outcome: $110K base (5% increase)

**Also ask for:**
- Sign-on bonus increase: $10K → $15K
- Equity increase: 5,000 options → 7,000 options

**Step 3: Prepare your justification**

**Don't just ask for more money. Explain why.**

**Justifications:**
1. **Market data:** "Based on my research on Levels.fyi and conversations with backend engineers in [city], I'm seeing $110K-$120K for this level."

2. **Other offers:** "I have another offer at $115K base. I prefer [Company] because [specific reasons], but I need to make a financially responsible decision."

3. **Unique value:** "Given my 9 years of operational experience managing large-scale systems, I believe I bring unique value beyond a typical entry-level backend engineer."

4. **Specific skills:** "My experience with [OSIsoft PI / SCADA / industrial systems] directly aligns with [Company's] focus and reduces my ramp-up time."

**Step 4: The negotiation call/email**

**Email (if you prefer written):**

```
Subject: Backend Engineer Offer - Questions and Discussion

Hi [Recruiter],

Thank you again for the offer! I'm very excited about the opportunity to join [Company]
and work with the team I met during the interview process.

I've reviewed the offer details, and I have a few questions and points I'd like to discuss:

1. Base Salary: Based on my research for backend engineers in [city] with my background,
I'm seeing a range of $110K-$120K. Given my 9 years of professional experience managing
large-scale distributed systems and my specific expertise in [relevant domain - industrial
software, SCADA, etc.], I was hoping we could adjust the base salary to $115K.

2. Sign-on Bonus: I'd need to leave my current employer on short notice, and I want to
ensure a smooth transition. Would it be possible to increase the sign-on bonus to $15K
to help with this transition?

3. Equity: I'm very excited about [Company's] growth potential. Would there be room to
adjust the equity grant to 7,000 options to reflect the value I'll bring to the team?

I want to reiterate that [Company] is my top choice because of [specific reasons - the
mission, the team, the technical challenges, etc.]. I'm hoping we can find a package
that works for both of us.

I'm happy to discuss this over a call if that's easier. When would be a good time to talk?

Thank you,
Leo
```

**Phone call (alternative):**

Same talking points, but conversational:

```
You: "Thank you for the offer. I'm really excited about [Company]. I do have a few
questions about the compensation package if you have a few minutes to discuss?"

Recruiter: "Of course!"

You: "Great. I've done some research, and based on what I'm seeing for backend engineers
with my background in [city], the market range seems to be $110K-$120K. I was hoping we
could adjust the base salary to $115K. Does that seem reasonable given my experience?"

[Listen to response]

You: "I also wanted to ask about the sign-on bonus and equity. Would there be flexibility
to increase the sign-on to $15K and the equity to 7,000 options?"

[Listen to response]

You: "I completely understand if there's not room on all of these, but I wanted to see
what's possible. [Company] is definitely my top choice, and I want to make sure we can
find a package that works."
```

**Step 5: Recruiter's response**

**Possible outcomes:**

**Outcome A: "Let me check with the hiring manager and get back to you."**
- This is good! They're considering it.
- Timeline: 1-3 days

**Outcome B: "We can't move on base, but we can increase sign-on to $15K."**

### Handling Multiple Offers

**Best position: 2-3 offers simultaneously**

**Leverage strategy:**

**If Company A makes offer first:**
1. Ask for 1 week to decide
2. Email companies B and C: "I have another offer with a deadline of [date]. I'm very interested in [Company B/C]. Is there any way to expedite the process?"
3. Often companies will accelerate if you have competing offer

**Comparing offers:**

| Factor | Company A (OSIsoft) | Company B (Uptake) | Company C (Datadog) | Weight |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| Base Salary | $105K | $110K | $115K | 25% |
| Total Comp Y1 | $125K | $135K | $145K | 25% |
| Learning/Growth | 9/10 (industrial domain) | 8/10 | 7/10 | 20% |
| Team/Manager | 9/10 (great fit) | 8/10 | 7/10 | 15% |
| Work-Life Balance | 8/10 | 6/10 (startup) | 8/10 | 10% |
| Mission/Impact | 10/10 (operated their software) | 9/10 | 7/10 | 5% |
| **Total Score** | **8.65** | **7.95** | **7.85** | |

**OSIsoft wins despite lower compensation** (better learning, team, mission fit)

**Decision rule:**
Don't optimize for compensation alone. First backend role is about:
1. **Learning** (what skills will you build?)
2. **Team** (who will you work with? Who will mentor you?)
3. **Impact** (will you work on meaningful projects?)
4. **Compensation** (competitive, but not the only factor)

**If offers are close, choose based on learning and team.**

## Part 6: Making the Decision

### Questions to Ask Before Accepting

**Ask hiring manager or future teammates:**

**About the role:**
1. "What would my first project be?"
2. "What does success look like in the first 3/6/12 months?"
3. "What's the biggest challenge the team is facing right now?"
4. "How much time is spent on new features vs maintenance/bug fixes?"

**About growth:**
5. "What does career progression look like for backend engineers?"
6. "How does the company support learning and development?"
7. "Would I have opportunities to work on different parts of the stack or different projects?"

**About team:**
8. "How big is the team? What's the experience level mix?"
9. "How does the team collaborate? (Daily standups, pair programming, code reviews?)"
10. "What's the on-call rotation like?"

**About culture:**
11. "How would you describe the engineering culture?"
12. "What do you love most about working here? What's been most challenging?"
13. "How does the company handle work-life balance?"

**Red flags (walk away if you see these):**

❌ Hiring manager can't clearly explain what you'd work on
❌ Existing team members seem unhappy or burnt out
❌ "We're a family" (code for no boundaries, long hours)
❌ "We work hard, play hard" (code for excessive hours)
❌ High turnover (team of 10 has 7 people with <1 year tenure)
❌ Unwilling to let you talk to future teammates
❌ Pressuring you to accept immediately ("offer expires in 24 hours")
❌ Vague answers about tech stack, processes, growth

**Green flags (great signs):**

✅ Clear explanation of role and first projects
✅ Team members are enthusiastic and engaged
✅ Emphasis on learning, mentorship, growth
✅ Healthy work-life balance (reasonable on-call, PTO encouraged)
✅ Clear career progression path
✅ Transparent about challenges
✅ Willing to answer all your questions
✅ Team seems to genuinely like each other and the work

### Trust Your Gut

**After all the data, scores, and analysis:**

Ask yourself:
- Am I excited to start?
- Do I respect the people I'd work with?
- Will I learn and grow here?
- Can I see myself here for 2-3 years?

**If answer is yes to all four → Accept the offer.**

## Part 9: Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Waiting Too Long to Apply

**What it looks like:**
"I'll apply when I'm 100% ready..."
Months pass, still preparing, never applying

**Why it's bad:**
- You'll never feel 100% ready
- Miss opportunities
- Lose momentum

**How to avoid:**
If you've completed Weeks 1-31 of this guide → You're ready. Apply Week 32.

### Mistake 2: Spray and Pray (No Targeting)

**What it looks like:**
Apply to 100 companies with same generic resume

**Why it's bad:**
- Low response rate
- Wastes time
- Doesn't leverage your unique background

**How to avoid:**
Target 30-40 companies strategically, tailor applications to top 10-15

### Mistake 3: Not Negotiating

**What it looks like:**
Accepting first offer without discussion

**Why it's bad:**
- Leave $10K-$30K on table
- Companies expect negotiation
- Sets low baseline for future raises

**How to avoid:**
Always negotiate. Even if you love the offer, ask for 10% more.

### Mistake 4: Optimizing Only for Compensation

**What it looks like:**
Taking highest-paying offer without considering learning, team, growth

**Why it's bad:**
- First backend role is about learning, not maximizing salary
- Wrong role with $10K more isn't worth it if you're miserable or not growing

**How to avoid:**
Use evaluation framework (learning, team, impact, compensation)

### Mistake 5: Burning Bridges

**What it looks like:**
- Ghosting companies after accepting elsewhere
- Being rude to recruiters
- Bad-mouthing companies

**Why it's bad:**
- Tech industry is small
- You might want to apply there in future
- Reputation matters

**How to avoid:**
- Respond to all communications professionally
- Decline offers politely with thanks
- Keep doors open
