# Section 28: Informational Interviews

**Part IV: Strategic Networking — Week 28**

**Overview:**
You've built your networking foundation (Section 25), optimized LinkedIn (Section 26), and deepened community engagement through events (Section 27). Now it's time to convert those connections into **informational interviews** - structured conversations that lead to referrals, insider knowledge, and job opportunities.

**What Is an Informational Interview?**
An informational interview is a 20-30 minute conversation where you learn about someone's role, company, or career path. Unlike a job interview (where you're being evaluated), you're the one asking questions. The goal is to gather information, build relationships, and position yourself for future opportunities.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Referrals come from conversations, not cold applications:** 70-80% of jobs are filled through referrals
- **Insider knowledge gives you an edge:** Learn what teams actually need (vs. what job descriptions say)
- **Practice articulating your story:** Every conversation is preparation for real interviews
- **Build advocates:** People who understand your background can champion you internally
- **Uncover hidden opportunities:** Many roles aren't publicly posted

**Week 28 Goals:**
1. Request 5-7 informational interviews from your network
2. Conduct 2-3 informational interviews this week
3. Master the informational interview structure and question framework
4. Convert interviews into ongoing relationships and potential referrals
5. Build a sustainable system for ongoing informational interviews

**Time Commitment:** 10-15 hours (Week 28) + ongoing 3-5 hours/week

## Part 2: How to Request an Informational Interview

### The Request Formula

**DO:**
- Keep it short (5-7 sentences max)
- Be specific about what you want (20-30 min conversation)
- Make it easy to say yes (offer specific time options or let them choose)
- Show you've done your homework (mention specific project, post, or company initiative)
- Lead with shared connection or context (warm intro, event, community, content)

**DON'T:**
- Ask for a job (not yet)
- Send your resume (unless they specifically ask)
- Write a long essay about yourself
- Be vague ("pick your brain" is too general)
- Make it all about you (balance curiosity about them with your context)

### Template 1: Warm Connection (Highest Success Rate)

**Use when:** You have mutual friend, former colleague, alumni connection, or met at event

**Subject Line:**
- "Quick question about [Company] - [Mutual Connection] suggested I reach out"
- "Following up from [Event Name]"
- "[School] alum → fellow [School] alum"

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out to you / We met at [Event Name] / I'm a fellow [School] alum - I saw you're now at [Company] working on [specific team/project].

I'm transitioning from pipeline operations (9 years managing SCADA systems at Navy and Kinder Morgan) into backend engineering with a focus on Spring Boot/Java. I'm particularly interested in [specific aspect of their company - industrial software, backend infrastructure, reliability engineering].

Would you have 20-30 minutes for a virtual coffee sometime in the next 2 weeks? I'd love to learn about your experience at [Company] and get your perspective on [specific question related to their work].

I'm flexible on timing - happy to work around your schedule. [If applicable: I'm available Tuesday/Wednesday afternoons or Friday mornings.]

Thanks for considering!

Best,
Leo

P.S. [Optional personal touch: "I really enjoyed your talk on [topic]" or "Your post about [topic] really resonated with my experience managing [specific system]"]
```

## Part 4: The Informational Interview Structure

### The 25-Minute Framework

**Minutes 1-3: Build Rapport and Set Agenda**

**What to Do:**
- Thank them for their time
- Small talk (if natural): "How's your week going?" "How's the weather in [their city]?"
- Set expectations: "I have 5-6 questions prepared, but happy to follow your lead"
- Give them brief context (60 seconds)

**Example Opening:**
```
"Thanks so much for taking the time to chat today, I really appreciate it.

Just to give you quick context: I spent 9 years managing petroleum pipeline SCADA systems - 4 in the Navy and 5 at Kinder Morgan. I actually used OSIsoft's PI System extensively to monitor 1,000+ miles of pipeline.

I'm now transitioning into backend engineering - I have a CS degree, went through a bootcamp, and I've built a Spring Boot library management system called Bibby. I'm really interested in industrial software where my operations background is an asset.

I'd love to learn about your experience at [Company] and get your advice on making this transition. Does that sound good?"
```

- **Ask for referral or next step** (if appropriate)
- Offer to help them (reciprocity)

**Example Closing:**
```
"This has been incredibly helpful - thank you so much. The part about [specific thing they said] really resonated with me, and I'm definitely going to [specific action based on their advice].

One last question: [Choose based on how conversation went]

OPTION A (If conversation went well):
"Based on what we've discussed, I think I'd be a good fit for [specific team/role] at [Company]. Would you be comfortable referring me when a relevant position opens up? I'm happy to send you my resume and can tailor it to whatever role makes sense."

OPTION B (If too early for referral):
"Is there anyone else at [Company] you'd recommend I talk to? I'd love to learn more about [specific team/aspect]."

OPTION C (External help):
"Are there any resources, communities, or people outside of [Company] you'd recommend I connect with?"

And please let me know if there's anything I can do to help you - I'm happy to [share resources about SCADA/operations, contribute to projects, make introductions, etc.]."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Shows gratitude and that you listened
- Clear ask (referral, introduction, or resources)

## Part 7: Converting Informational Interviews to Referrals

### When to Ask for a Referral

**DON'T ask in the first informational interview UNLESS:**
- They explicitly offer: "I'd be happy to refer you"
- There's an open role that's perfect fit and they suggest it
- You had an incredibly strong conversation and built immediate rapport

**DO ask for referral:**
- After 2-3 touch points (informational interview + 1-2 follow-ups)
- When there's an open position that's a good fit
- When you've added value to them (helped, made intro, shared resources)
- When they've expressed enthusiasm about your background

### How to Ask for a Referral

**Template 1: Direct Ask (After Multiple Touch Points)**

```
Subject: Backend Engineer role at [Company] - would you be open to referring me?

Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out because I saw [Company] posted a [specific role] position, and based on our conversation [X weeks ago], it seems like a great fit.

Since we last talked, I've [update on progress - completed project, published article, learned technology they suggested]. I'm really excited about the possibility of working at [Company], especially [specific reason based on your conversation].

Would you be comfortable referring me for this position? I'm happy to send you my resume tailored to the role, and I can share any additional information that would be helpful.

I know employee referrals are a big ask, so no pressure at all - I completely understand if you'd prefer to wait until we've had more chances to connect.

Either way, thanks for all your help so far!

Best,
Leo
```

**Template 2: Softer Ask (After Initial Interview)**

```
Subject: Following up - any advice on applying to [Company]?

Hi [Name],

I saw [Company] has an opening for [specific role], and I'm planning to apply. Based on our conversation, I think my background in [operational experience + technical skills] would be a strong fit, especially for [specific aspect of the role].

I wanted to ask: what's the best way to apply? Should I apply directly through the website, or is there a better approach?

Also, if you feel comfortable after our conversation and think I'd be a good fit, I'd be grateful for a referral. But I completely understand if you'd like to connect more first - either way, I'd love to stay in touch!

Thanks again for your time and advice.

Best,
Leo
```

**What Happens Next:**

**If they say yes:**
- Send them your resume tailored to the specific role
- Provide 3-4 bullet points highlighting why you're a fit (makes it easy for them to advocate for you)
- Thank them profusely
- Keep them updated on interview progress

**If they say "let's connect more first":**
- Respect the boundary
- Continue relationship building (add value, periodic check-ins)
- Ask again in 1-2 months after building more rapport

**If they say no or ignore:**
- Thank them anyway
- Continue relationship casually (you never know what might happen in the future)
- Don't take it personally - there are many reasons people decline (company policy, don't know you well enough, not in position to refer)

## Part 10: Advanced Tactics

### Tactic 1: The Multi-Interview Strategy

**Instead of one informational interview per company, aim for 2-3:**

**Interview 1:** Backend engineer (peer level)
- Learn about day-to-day, technical stack, team dynamics

**Interview 2:** Engineering manager
- Learn about hiring process, what they look for, team needs

**Interview 3:** Someone with similar background (operations → engineering transition)
- Learn about how they made the transition, what helped, challenges

**Why This Works:**
- Shows genuine interest (not just checking a box)
- Multiple perspectives give fuller picture
- Multiple people can refer you (increases odds)
- Builds familiarity with company

**How to Execute:**
At end of Interview 1, ask: "Is there anyone else on the team you'd recommend I talk to?"

### Tactic 2: The Group Informational Interview

**Ask if you can join a team lunch or coffee with 2-3 people:**

**Message:**
```
"I know your time is valuable - would it be easier if I joined you and a couple teammates for lunch or coffee? I'd love to meet more of the team and hear different perspectives."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Efficient for them (one time slot, multiple people meet you)
- You get multiple perspectives in one conversation
- More casual and natural
- Increases your visibility in the company

### Tactic 3: The "Second-Degree Introduction" Strategy

**When someone can't meet but wants to help:**

**Your message:**
```
"No worries if you're too busy for a call right now. Would you be open to introducing me to someone else on your team who might have time? I'm specifically interested in learning about [specific aspect]."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Lower commitment than interview (just an email intro)
- They're likely to intro you to someone receptive
- Warm intro has higher response rate than cold outreach

### Tactic 4: The Content Collaboration

**After informational interview with someone you really connected with:**

**Your message (2-3 weeks later):**
```
"I've been thinking about our conversation about [topic]. I'm considering writing an article about [related topic] - would you be interested in collaborating or giving feedback? I'd love to include your perspective."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Continues relationship in meaningful way
- Positions you as peer/collaborator (not just job seeker)
- Creates reason to stay in touch
- If published, they'll share (extends your reach)

## Part 11: Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Treating It Like a Job Interview

**What It Looks Like:**
- Talking about yourself too much (80% you, 20% them)
- Bringing up your resume unprompted
- Asking for a job immediately
- Being too formal or scripted

**How to Avoid:**
- **80% them, 20% you:** They should do most of the talking
- Give context (60 seconds), then ask questions
- Be conversational, not interrogative
- Don't mention resume unless they ask

### Mistake 2: Asking Questions You Could Have Googled

**What It Looks Like:**
- "What does your company do?"
- "What technologies does [Company] use?"
- "Where is [Company] headquartered?"

**How to Avoid:**
- Do basic research before (30 minutes minimum)
- Ask questions that require insider perspective:
  - "I read your engineering blog post about microservices - how has that architecture evolved since?"
  - "I saw you use Kubernetes - what's the biggest challenge you've faced with it?"

### Mistake 3: No Clear Ask or Next Step

**What It Looks Like:**
- Conversation ends with "thanks, bye"
- No follow-up plan
- Don't ask for referral, intro, or resources
- Never talk to them again

**How to Avoid:**
- **Always end with a clear ask:** Referral (if appropriate), introduction, resources, permission to follow up
- **Always follow up:** Thank you email same day, value-add within a week
- **Always plan next touch point:** Monthly check-in, comment on their content, share update

### Mistake 4: Only Reaching Out When You Need Something

**What It Looks Like:**
- Ghost for 3 months, then ask for referral
- Only contact when there's open job
- Never engage with their content or add value

**How to Avoid:**
- **Relationship first, opportunity second**
- Check in monthly even when you don't need anything
- Add value regularly (share articles, make intros, engage with content)
- When opportunity arises, relationship is already strong

### Mistake 5: Not Respecting Their Time

**What It Looks Like:**
- Asking for 1 hour when they offered 30 minutes
- Going over time limit
- Asking questions you could have asked over email
- Not being prepared

**How to Avoid:**
- Stick to agreed time limit (set phone timer for 25 min to be safe)
- Come prepared with specific questions
- Be efficient with your story (60 seconds, not 10 minutes)
- If they offer more time, great; if not, wrap up professionally

## Part 13: Success Stories - What This Looks Like in Practice

### Example 1: Event Contact → Informational Interview → Referral

**Week 27:** Leo attends SpringOne Tour, approaches speaker (Sarah from OSIsoft) after talk about time-series data performance
**Week 27 (Day 2):** Leo sends LinkedIn connection with personalized note referencing the talk
**Week 28:** Leo requests informational interview: "Would love to learn about your work at OSIsoft"
**Week 28:** Interview goes well - Leo shares SCADA background, Sarah shares what backend team works on
**Week 29:** Leo follows up with article about time-series data, Sarah finds it useful and shares
**Week 30:** OSIsoft posts backend engineer opening, Leo applies and reaches out to Sarah
**Week 30:** Sarah refers Leo - resume goes to top of pile, interview scheduled

**Key Success Factor:** Relationship built over 4 weeks before asking for referral

### Example 2: Cold Outreach → Informational Interview → Introduction

**Week 28:** Leo sends cold outreach to Mike (engineering manager at Uptake) with operations → engineering angle
**Week 28:** Mike responds (interested in operations background), schedules 30-min call
**Week 29:** Interview goes well - Mike appreciates Leo's operational experience but his team isn't hiring
**Week 29:** Mike introduces Leo to Jennifer (backend lead at Uptake's different division) - warm intro
**Week 30:** Leo has informational interview with Jennifer, team IS hiring
**Week 31:** Leo applies with Jennifer's referral, gets interview

**Key Success Factor:** Even when first contact can't help directly, they can open doors

### Example 3: Community → Informational Interview → Long-Term Relationship

**Week 20 (from Section 20):** Leo helps David debug Spring Boot cache issue on Discord
**Week 26:** Leo engages with David's LinkedIn posts about industrial IoT
**Week 28:** Leo requests informational interview (David works at Honeywell)
**Week 28:** Interview goes well - both interested in industrial software, ongoing relationship begins
**Weeks 29-35:** Leo and David check in monthly, share resources, comment on each other's content
**Week 36:** David's team starts hiring, immediately thinks of Leo and reaches out proactively

**Key Success Factor:** Added value before asking; built genuine long-term relationship

## Final Thoughts: The Long Game

**Informational interviews are not a one-time tactic - they're a relationship-building practice.**

Most people fail at informational interviews because they treat them transactionally:
- Request interview → Get information → Ask for job → Ghost if no job

**The approach that works:**
- Request interview → Build genuine connection → Add value → Stay in touch → Opportunity emerges naturally (often months later)

**By the end of Week 28, you should:**
- Have conducted 2-3 informational interviews
- Have 5-10 pending requests sent
- Have a system for tracking and following up
- Understand how to convert conversations into referrals (not immediately, but over time)

**Remember:**
- **70-80% of jobs come from referrals**
- **Referrals require relationships**
- **Relationships require time, consistency, and reciprocity**

**You have a compelling story** (Navy → pipeline operations → backend engineering), **relevant expertise** (9 years managing critical infrastructure), and **technical credibility** (Bibby project, Spring Boot focus).

Now it's time to get in front of people at target companies and let them know you exist. One conversation at a time.

**Next:** Sections 29-32 will cover interview mastery - technical, system design, behavioral, and job search. The informational interviews you conduct this week will:
1. Give you insider knowledge to prepare better for real interviews
2. Generate referrals that lead to those interviews
3. Provide practice articulating your story and background

**The foundation is built. Now it's time to execute.**
