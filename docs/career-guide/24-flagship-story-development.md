# Section 24: Flagship Story Development

**Week 24 Focus:** Crafting Your Compelling Career Narrative

---

## Introduction: Your Story Is Your Advantage

You've built technical skills (Sections 1-16). You've created content and community presence (Sections 17-23). Now you need a story that ties it all together.

**Why your story matters:**

Traditional candidates say: "I studied CS at [University], interned at [Company], now I'm a software engineer."

You say: "I spent 4 years managing fuel systems on a Navy destroyer, then 5 years operating petroleum pipelines at Kinder Morgan. I saw firsthand how software could make or break critical operations. So I earned my CS degree while working full-time, built a library management system that demonstrates enterprise patterns I learned from industrial monitoring, and now I'm bringing operational reliability thinking to backend engineering."

**One is forgettable. The other is memorable.**

**The career changer's paradox:**

- **Weakness:** Less professional software experience
- **Strength:** Unique career story that differentiates you

**Your story transforms the weakness into strength.**

**This week's mission:** Craft your flagship story—the narrative that explains who you are, why you made the transition, what makes you different, and where you're going. Perfect it through iteration. Deploy it in every professional conversation.

## Part 1: What Makes a Compelling Flagship Story

Not all career stories are created equal.

### The Elements of a Compelling Story

**1. Specific Details (Not Generic)**

**Weak:** "I worked in operations before software engineering."

**Strong:** "I spent 5 years at Kinder Morgan monitoring pipeline SCADA systems, watching real-time data from 1,000+ miles of petroleum pipelines. When alarms triggered at 2 AM, decisions had seconds, not hours."

**Specificity = Credibility = Memorability**

**2. Clear Turning Point**

**Weak:** "I decided to switch to software."

**Strong:** "I was troubleshooting a SCADA integration issue at 3 AM and realized: I'm solving the problem the software created. I want to build the software that solves problems, not creates them."

**Every good story has a "why now" moment.**

**3. Obstacle and Growth**

**Weak:** "I learned to code and now I'm a software engineer."

**Strong:** "Earning my CS degree while working 50-hour weeks at Kinder Morgan was brutal. I'd finish a night shift, sleep 4 hours, then code before the next shift. But managing that taught me systems thinking—whether it's petroleum distribution or software architecture, you're managing inputs, state, outputs, and failure modes."

**Struggle makes the story real. Growth makes it inspiring.**

**4. Unique Synthesis**

**Weak:** "I have both operations and software experience."

**Strong:** "Most backend engineers have never been on the receiving end of software they build. I have. I've been the operations person at 2 AM dealing with systems that fail. That perspective shapes every line of code I write—I build for the operator who has to debug it under pressure."

**Your unique combination is your competitive advantage.**

**5. Clear Direction**

**Weak:** "I'm looking for software engineering jobs."

**Strong:** "I'm targeting backend roles at industrial software companies like OSIsoft, Uptake, or Rockwell Automation—places where my operational domain expertise is an asset, not just a footnote. I want to build software for the operations teams I used to be part of."

**Specificity of direction shows intentionality.**

### The Three-Act Structure

All great stories follow this arc:

**Act 1: Before (The Setup)**
- Who you were
- What you did
- What you learned
- What was limiting about it

**Act 2: The Transition (The Journey)**
- The catalyst (why you changed)
- The obstacles (what made it hard)
- The growth (what you learned)
- The proof (what you built)

**Act 3: After (The Destination)**
- Who you are now
- What you bring that others don't
- Where you're going
- What you're looking for

**Your story in three acts:**

**Act 1 (Before):** "I spent 9 years in petroleum operations—4 in the Navy managing fuel systems on a destroyer, then 5 at Kinder Morgan operating pipeline SCADA. I learned systems thinking, reliability engineering, and what happens when software fails at critical moments."

**Act 2 (Transition):** "I realized I wanted to build the software, not just use it. So I earned my CS degree while working full-time, completed a bootcamp to modernize my skills, and built Bibby—a library management system using enterprise patterns I learned from industrial monitoring. Sub-50ms response times, Redis caching, real-time analytics—I built it like I'd build operational software."

**Act 3 (After):** "Now I bring operational reliability thinking to backend engineering. I'm targeting companies like OSIsoft and Uptake where my operations background makes me better at building industrial software, not just another junior dev learning on the job."

## Part 2: Crafting Your Flagship Story (Full Version)

The full version is 90-120 seconds. Used in interviews, networking coffees, conference introductions.

### Structure Breakdown

**Opening Hook (10 seconds)**

Grab attention immediately.

**Weak:** "I used to work in operations."

**Strong:** "I've shut down petroleum pipelines when pressure anomalies suggested a leak. In those moments, the SCADA software is everything—and sometimes it's terrible."

**Better:** "At 2 AM on a cold night in January 2019, I was monitoring 1,000 miles of petroleum pipeline from a control room in Houston. An alarm triggered. I had 90 seconds to decide: false alarm or actual leak. The software gave me the data. My experience gave me the judgment."

**You want them leaning in.**

**Background - Before (30 seconds)**

Set the stage: who you were, what you did, what you learned.

**Your version:**

"I spent 4 years in the Navy as a petroleum systems technician on a destroyer—managing fuel storage, distribution, and safety systems. Then 5 years at Kinder Morgan operating pipeline SCADA systems. I monitored real-time data, responded to alarms, coordinated with field teams, and ensured we never had an incident.

What I learned: Systems thinking is universal. Whether you're managing fuel flow or database queries, you're thinking about inputs, outputs, state, failure modes, and recovery. I also learned that good software saves lives. Bad software creates emergencies."

**The Catalyst - Why You Changed (20 seconds)**

What made you transition? Be specific about the moment or realization.

**Your version:**

"I was troubleshooting a SCADA integration issue for the third time that month. The software vendor's fix didn't understand our operational context. I kept thinking: I could build this better. I understand the domain. I understand what operators need. I just need to learn to code professionally.

That's when I decided to pursue software engineering. Not just to write code—to build operational software that doesn't fail at 2 AM."

**The Journey - How You Made It Happen (20 seconds)**

Obstacles + growth. Show it wasn't easy, but you did it.

**Your version:**

"I earned my CS degree while working full-time at Kinder Morgan—night shifts, weekends, brutal schedule. Then I completed a bootcamp to modernize my skills with frameworks like Spring Boot and React.

Most importantly, I built Bibby—a library management system that demonstrates the patterns I learned from industrial monitoring. Real-time analytics with sub-50ms response times, Redis caching for performance, monitoring dashboards inspired by SCADA design. I built it like I'd build operational software: reliable first, fast second."

**The Synthesis - What Makes You Different (15 seconds)**

Connect the dots. What do you bring that others don't?

**Your version:**

"Most backend engineers have never operated the systems they build. I have. I've been the person at 2 AM debugging someone else's code. That perspective shapes everything I build—I think about operators, error messages, debuggability, graceful degradation. I build for the operations teams I used to be part of."

**The Direction - Where You're Going (15 seconds)**

Be specific about what you're looking for.

**Your version:**

"I'm targeting backend engineering roles at industrial software companies—OSIsoft, Uptake, Rockwell Automation, Honeywell—places where operational domain expertise isn't just nice to have, it's a competitive advantage. I want to build the next generation of industrial software, informed by 9 years of operational experience and modern software engineering practices."

**Total: 90-120 seconds**

### Full Story Script (Practice Version)

**Put it all together:**

---

"At 2 AM on a cold night in January 2019, I was monitoring 1,000 miles of petroleum pipeline from a control room in Houston. An alarm triggered. I had 90 seconds to decide: false alarm or actual leak. The software gave me the data. My experience gave me the judgment.

I spent 4 years in the Navy as a petroleum systems technician on a destroyer, managing fuel storage and distribution. Then 5 years at Kinder Morgan operating pipeline SCADA systems—real-time monitoring, alarm response, ensuring zero incidents.

What I learned: Systems thinking is universal. Good software saves lives. Bad software creates emergencies.

I was troubleshooting a SCADA integration for the third time that month when I realized: I could build this better. I understand the domain and what operators need. I just needed to learn to code professionally.

So I earned my CS degree while working full-time at Kinder Morgan—brutal schedule, but I did it. Then completed a bootcamp to modernize my skills. And I built Bibby, a library management system demonstrating enterprise patterns from industrial monitoring. Real-time analytics, sub-50ms responses, Redis caching—built like operational software: reliable first, fast second.

Most backend engineers have never operated the systems they build. I have. I've debugged code at 2 AM under pressure. That shapes everything—I build for operators, thinking about error messages, debuggability, graceful degradation.

I'm targeting backend roles at industrial software companies like OSIsoft and Uptake, where my operational expertise is a competitive advantage. I want to build the next generation of industrial software, informed by 9 years in operations and modern engineering practices."

## Part 3: Story Variations for Different Contexts

One story, multiple versions.

### The 30-Second Elevator Pitch

**Context:** Chance meeting, career fair, brief introduction

**Structure:** Who you were → Why you changed → Who you are now

**Your version:**

"I'm Leo, a software engineer with an unusual background—9 years in petroleum operations, Navy and Kinder Morgan. I was operating the software and realized I wanted to build it instead. Earned my CS degree while working full-time, built an enterprise-grade library system, and now I'm focused on backend engineering for industrial software companies where my operations background is an asset."

**30 seconds. Hits the key points. Ends with clear positioning.**

### The 60-Second Networking Version

**Context:** Meetup, conference, informational interview

**Structure:** Hook → Background → Transition → Current

**Your version:**

"I spent 5 years at Kinder Morgan monitoring petroleum pipeline SCADA systems—1,000+ miles of pipeline, real-time data, 2 AM alarm responses. Before that, 4 years in the Navy managing fuel systems on a destroyer.

I realized I wanted to build the software, not just operate it. So I went back to school—CS degree while working full-time, then a bootcamp for Spring Boot and modern frameworks. Built Bibby, a library management system with patterns from industrial monitoring: real-time analytics, sub-50ms response times, operational dashboards.

Now I'm bringing that operational reliability mindset to backend engineering. Targeting companies like OSIsoft or Uptake where domain expertise in operations is a differentiator."

**60 seconds. Conversational. Invites follow-up questions.**

### The Interview Answer Version

**Context:** "Tell me about yourself" in job interview

**Structure:** Recent → Relevant → Why you're here

**Your version:**

"I'm a backend engineer focused on building reliable systems for operational contexts. My path here is a bit different—I spent 9 years in petroleum operations, which taught me systems thinking and what reliability really means in critical environments.

Most recently, I built Bibby, a library management system using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Redis. I implemented real-time analytics with sub-50ms response times, caching strategies to reduce database load by 40x, and monitoring dashboards inspired by the SCADA systems I operated for years.

Before software, I was at Kinder Morgan managing pipeline SCADA operations, and before that, 4 years in the Navy. That operational background shapes how I build software—I think about failure modes, graceful degradation, and building for the operator who has to debug at 2 AM.

I'm here because [Company Name]'s focus on [specific thing about company, e.g., industrial IoT/SCADA integration/operational software] aligns perfectly with my background. My operations expertise plus modern backend skills means I can build software that actually solves operational problems, not just checks technical boxes."

**90 seconds. Tailored to the company. Ends with why you're interested in them specifically.**

## Part 4: Incorporating Storytelling Techniques

Make your story stick.

### Technique 1: Sensory Details

**Generic:** "I worked in a control room."

**With sensory details:** "In the control room at 2 AM, six monitors glowing in the dark, coffee cold, phone on the desk waiting for field team calls. The alarm sound still makes my heart rate spike—a sharp beep that meant you had seconds to respond."

**Sensory details make stories vivid and memorable.**

**Use sparingly:** One or two moments with sensory detail, not the whole story.

### Technique 2: The Specific Number

**Generic:** "I managed a lot of pipeline infrastructure."

**With specific number:** "I monitored 1,000+ miles of petroleum pipeline."

**Specific numbers = concrete = credible.**

**Examples in your story:**
- "4 years in the Navy"
- "5 years at Kinder Morgan"
- "1,000+ miles of pipeline"
- "Sub-50ms response times"
- "40x performance improvement"
- "2 AM alarm responses"

### Technique 3: Contrast

**Generic:** "I wanted to change careers."

**With contrast:** "In operations, I fixed problems software created. In engineering, I want to create software that solves problems."

**Contrast highlights the shift.**

**More examples:**
- "Before: I was the person calling the vendor at 3 AM. Now: I want to build software that doesn't need those calls."
- "Most engineers build first, debug later. I debug before I build—operational mindset."
- "Traditional developers learn systems from textbooks. I learned from alarms at 2 AM."

### Technique 4: The "What If" Moment

**Generic:** "I decided to learn to code."

**With "what if":** "I kept thinking: What if the people building SCADA systems actually understood operations? What if we built software for operators, not just for specifications?"

**"What if" shows your thinking process and makes the decision feel intentional, not random.**

### Technique 5: The Callback

**Set up early:** "In the Navy, we had a saying: 'Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.'"

**Callback later:** "When I'm building backend systems now, I remember: slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Take time to build it right the first time."

**Callbacks create cohesion and show how your past informs your present.**

### Technique 6: Show, Don't Tell

**Tell:** "I'm good at systems thinking."

**Show:** "When I'm debugging a performance issue, I trace it like a pipeline leak—check the input (API requests), check the state (database), check the output (response times), look for bottlenecks (caching, queries), isolate the failure point. Same process, different system."

**Showing is more credible than telling.**

---

## Part 5: Common Storytelling Mistakes

What to avoid.

### Mistake 1: Apologizing for Your Background

**Wrong:** "I know I don't have as much software experience as other candidates, but..."

**Right:** "My path to software engineering is different, which gives me a perspective most developers lack."

**Never apologize for your background. It's your differentiator.**

### Mistake 2: Too Much Detail

**Wrong:** "In the Navy, I was stationed at Naval Base San Diego from 2015 to 2019, assigned to USS Example (DDG-123), where I held the position of Petty Officer Third Class, working in the Engineering Department, specifically the Fuel Division, where my responsibilities included daily fuel oil system inspections, conducting pressure tests every 72 hours, maintaining fuel transfer pump systems..."

**Right:** "I spent 4 years in the Navy managing fuel systems on a destroyer—storage, distribution, safety systems."

**Your story should be a highlight reel, not a documentary.**

**Rule:** If a detail doesn't serve the narrative arc, cut it.

### Mistake 3: No Clear "Why"

**Wrong:** "I worked in operations, then I learned to code, now I'm a software engineer."

**Right:** "I was troubleshooting a SCADA integration issue for the third time and realized: I could build this better. That's why I transitioned."

**Every career change needs a clear catalyst. Without it, the story feels arbitrary.**

### Mistake 4: Underselling Your Achievements

**Wrong:** "I built a small library project to practice coding."

**Right:** "I built Bibby, an enterprise-grade library management system with real-time analytics, sub-50ms response times, and Redis caching—demonstrating the patterns I learned from industrial monitoring systems."

**Don't minimize what you've built. If it demonstrates technical skill, say so.**

### Mistake 5: Generic Ending

**Wrong:** "So now I'm looking for software engineering opportunities."

**Right:** "I'm targeting backend roles at industrial software companies like OSIsoft and Uptake, where my operational domain expertise makes me uniquely valuable."

**Specific direction shows intentionality and makes it easier for people to help you.**

### Mistake 6: Reading from a Script

**Wrong:** Memorizing word-for-word, then reciting robotically.

**Right:** Memorizing the structure and key phrases, then telling it conversationally.

**Your story should feel natural, not rehearsed.**

**Practice enough that you can tell it without thinking about what comes next, but not so much that it sounds canned.**

### Mistake 7: Ignoring the Listener

**Wrong:** Monologuing for 2 minutes without reading the room.

**Right:** Watching for interest, adjusting length based on context, inviting questions.

**If interviewer looks impatient at 60 seconds, wrap up. If they're leaning in and engaged, give more detail.**

**Your story is a conversation starter, not a speech.**

---

## Part 6: Practicing and Refining Your Story

A great story requires iteration.

### Practice Method 1: Record Yourself

**Process:**

1. **Record video of yourself telling the full 90-second story**
   - Phone camera is fine
   - No editing, just one take

2. **Watch it (you'll hate it, watch anyway)**
   - Note verbal tics ("um," "uh," "like")
   - Note pacing (too fast? too slow?)
   - Note energy (flat? too hyper?)
   - Note clarity (would someone understand your journey?)

3. **Make one specific improvement**
   - Don't fix everything at once
   - Pick one thing: pace, energy, or cutting filler words

4. **Record again**

5. **Repeat until you'd be comfortable showing this to a recruiter**

**Goal:** 5-10 recordings over 2-3 days.

### Practice Method 2: Tell It to Real People

**Tier 1: Safe audience (spouse, close friend)**

Ask them:
- "Was anything confusing?"
- "What stands out?"
- "What questions do you have?"
- "Does this make sense for why I changed careers?"

**Tier 2: Semi-safe audience (classmate, bootcamp peer)**

Ask them:
- "Would you hire me based on this story?"
- "What part was most compelling?"
- "What part could I cut?"

**Tier 3: Real audience (informational interview, networking coffee)**

Don't ask for feedback directly—observe:
- Do they lean in?
- Do they ask follow-up questions?
- Do they make connections to opportunities?

**Tell your story to 10 different people before your first real interview.**

**You'll notice:**
- Some parts always land well → keep them
- Some parts confuse people → clarify or cut
- Some parts bore people → cut them

### Practice Method 3: The Written Version

**Write out your story word-for-word.**

**Then:**

1. **Cut 20% of the words** (force yourself to be concise)
2. **Bold the key phrases** (the parts you must remember)
3. **Read it aloud** (does it sound like you talking or like a corporate press release?)
4. **Revise for conversational tone**

**Example:**

**Original:**
"Subsequently, I made the determination to pursue a career transition into the field of software engineering..."

**Revised:**
"I decided to switch to software engineering."

**Reading aloud catches corporate-speak you wouldn't notice otherwise.**

### Practice Method 4: Context Switching

Practice telling different versions based on context:

**Monday:** 30-second elevator pitch (career fair scenario)
**Tuesday:** 60-second networking version (meetup scenario)
**Wednesday:** 90-second interview version (job interview scenario)
**Thursday:** Written LinkedIn summary (revise and update)
**Friday:** Conference bio (third person, 100 words)

**Switching contexts helps you internalize the core story while adapting to situations.**

### Refinement Checklist

After practicing, ask:

**Structure:**
- [ ] Does my story follow the three-act structure? (Before, Transition, After)
- [ ] Is there a clear catalyst for why I changed careers?
- [ ] Do I show growth and obstacles, not just outcomes?

**Content:**
- [ ] Do I include specific numbers and details?
- [ ] Do I mention Bibby and what it demonstrates?
- [ ] Do I articulate what makes me different from other candidates?
- [ ] Do I state what I'm looking for specifically?

**Delivery:**
- [ ] Can I tell it in 30, 60, and 90 seconds?
- [ ] Does it sound conversational, not scripted?
- [ ] Do I maintain eye contact (not reading from notes)?
- [ ] Does my energy match the content?

**Impact:**
- [ ] Do people ask follow-up questions?
- [ ] Do people remember me after hearing it?
- [ ] Does it lead to actionable next steps (intros, referrals, interviews)?

**If you answer "no" to any of these, refine and practice more.**

## Part 7: Deploying Your Story in Different Situations

When and how to tell it.

### Situation 1: Job Interview - "Tell Me About Yourself"

**When it comes up:** First question in 80% of interviews

**Your approach:**

**Version:** 90-second interview version (from Part 3)

**Start:** "I'm a backend engineer focused on building reliable systems for operational contexts..."

**Middle:** Cover background, transition, Bibby, what you bring

**End:** "...which is why I'm here. [Company]'s focus on [specific thing] aligns perfectly with my background."

**Follow-up:** Pause, let them ask questions

**Common follow-up questions:**
- "Tell me more about your time at Kinder Morgan"
- "What was the biggest challenge in transitioning?"
- "How do you think your operations background helps with software?"

**Prepare answers to these in advance.**

### Situation 2: Networking Coffee

**Context:** Informational interview, coffee chat, introduced by mutual connection

**Your approach:**

**Version:** 60-second networking version

**When to deploy:** After initial pleasantries, when they ask "So what's your background?"

**After telling it:** Ask them questions
- "What's your path to [their role]?"
- "How did you get into [their company]?"
- "What do you think about my positioning? Would someone with my background fit at [their company]?"

**Your story should take 30-40% of the conversation. Spend 60-70% listening and asking questions.**

### Situation 3: Career Fair or Conference

**Context:** 30-second interaction, many people

**Your approach:**

**Version:** 30-second elevator pitch

**Deploy:** After "What do you do?"

**End with ask:** "I'd love to learn more about [company/role]. Is there a good time to follow up?"

**Goal:** Not to tell your whole story, but to be memorable enough that they accept your LinkedIn request and remember you later.

### Situation 4: LinkedIn Profile

**Context:** Always visible, passive networking

**Your approach:**

**Version:** Written LinkedIn summary (from Part 3)

**Update:** Every 3-6 months as you accomplish more

**Key sections:**
- Hook (first 2 sentences)
- Background synthesis
- Current work (Bibby, blog, open source)
- What you're looking for
- Contact/links

**Optimize for scanning:** Short paragraphs, bullet points, keywords

### Situation 5: Speaking Opportunity

**Context:** Introducing yourself before a talk (Section 21)

**Your approach:**

**Version:** Conference speaker bio (third person)

**When to use:** Organizer asks for bio, or you introduce yourself before presenting

**Focus:** Credentials + unique angle + what you're talking about

**Example:**
"Before I dive in, quick background: I'm Leo, a backend engineer with 9 years in petroleum operations before software. That operational background shapes how I think about building reliable systems, which is what this talk is about."

**30 seconds, then into your talk content.**

### Situation 6: Cold Email or Outreach

**Context:** Reaching out to someone you don't know

**Your approach:**

**Version:** Written, 3-sentence version

**Example:**

"I'm Leo, a backend engineer with an unusual background—9 years in petroleum operations (Navy + Kinder Morgan) before transitioning to software. I built an enterprise library system demonstrating patterns from industrial monitoring, and I'm now focused on backend roles at industrial software companies. I came across your work on [specific thing] and would love to learn more about your experience at [company]."

**3 sentences. Hook, credentials, ask.**

---

## Part 8: Your Story Evolution Over Time

Your story isn't static.

### Version 1.0 (Today - Week 24)

**Focus:** Career transition story
- Why you changed
- What you've built
- Where you're going

**Example:** "I was in operations, transitioned to software, built Bibby, targeting industrial software companies."

### Version 2.0 (6 Months - After First Job)

**Focus:** What you've accomplished in software
- Transition is still part of story, but less prominent
- Real work experience takes center stage

**Example:** "I'm a backend engineer at [Company], working on [industrial software product]. Before software, I spent 9 years in petroleum operations, which gives me unique insight into building for operational teams..."

**Transition moves from foreground to background.**

### Version 3.0 (2 Years - Established Engineer)

**Focus:** What you're an expert in
- Operations background is differentiation, not the main story
- Your software work is the primary credential

**Example:** "I build backend systems for industrial automation, specializing in real-time data processing and operational reliability. My background in petroleum operations informs my approach, but I've been building production software for 2+ years now..."

**Operations background is flavor, not foundation.**

### Version 4.0 (5+ Years - Senior Engineer/Leader)

**Focus:** Your impact and leadership
- Background is mentioned briefly if at all
- Your body of work speaks for itself

**Example:** "I lead the backend team at [Industrial Software Company], focused on SCADA integration and real-time analytics. I bring an operational mindset to engineering, having worked in petroleum operations before software..."

**One sentence reference. Your work has replaced your origin story.**

**Update your story as you grow. What's compelling today won't be in 5 years.**

---

## Conclusion: Your Story Is Your Competitive Advantage

You have something most software engineers don't: a compelling career story.

**The typical candidate:**
"I studied CS, did some internships, now I'm looking for a job."
- Forgettable
- Interchangeable
- Competes on technical skills alone

**You:**
"I spent 9 years in petroleum operations, saw software fail at critical moments, decided to build it better. Earned my CS degree while working full-time, built an enterprise system demonstrating operational patterns, and now I'm bringing reliability thinking to backend engineering at industrial software companies."
- Memorable
- Unique
- Competes on technical skills + operational expertise + compelling narrative

**Your story:**
- Opens doors (recruiters remember you)
- Wins interviews (interviewers lean in)
- Closes offers (companies value unique backgrounds)

**But only if you tell it well.**

**Week 24 success = Story written, practiced, and deployed across all professional contexts.**

You've spent 23 weeks building skills, content, community, and credibility. Now you have a story that ties it all together and explains why you're not just another junior developer—you're a backend engineer with operational reliability expertise that most developers will never have.

**That's not a weakness. That's a superpower.**

**Tell that story. Own it. Deploy it. Watch doors open.**
