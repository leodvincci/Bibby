# Section 25: Networking Fundamentals

**Week 25 Focus:** Building Genuine Professional Relationships That Lead to Opportunities

---

## Introduction: Why Networking Matters More for Career Changers

The statistics are stark:

- **70-85%** of jobs are filled through networking, not job applications
- **Referrals** are 4x more likely to get hired than cold applicants
- **Career changers** with strong networks transition 3x faster than those without

**The career changer's challenge:**

Traditional candidates have built-in networks:
- College alumni network (hundreds of connections)
- Previous company colleagues (50-200+ people)
- Internship connections (20-50 people)
- **Total:** 300-500 professional connections in tech

**You're starting from:**
- Navy connections (not in software)
- Kinder Morgan connections (mostly in operations, not software)
- Bootcamp peers (20-50 people, also job searching)
- **Total:** 20-50 direct connections in software

**The gap:** 250-450 connections you need to build.

**The good news:** You can close this gap in 6-12 months with strategic networking.

**This week's mission:** Understand what networking really is (and isn't), develop your networking strategy, initiate your first 10 genuine connections, and establish habits that will build a 300+ person network over the next year.

## Part 1: Reframing Networking

Most people hate networking because they misunderstand it.

### What Networking Is NOT

**Not:** Collecting business cards and LinkedIn connections like Pokemon
**Not:** Asking strangers for jobs
**Not:** Transactional exchanges ("I'll help you if you help me")
**Not:** Faking interest in people to get what you want
**Not:** Attending every networking event and talking to everyone

**These approaches feel gross and don't work.**

### What Networking Actually Is

**Networking is:**

**1. Building genuine relationships with people whose work interests you**

You're not networking with everyone in tech. You're connecting with:
- People working at companies you'd want to work at
- People solving problems similar to yours
- People with career paths you admire
- People whose content you genuinely find valuable

**Quality > quantity.** 10 genuine relationships > 500 LinkedIn connections who don't remember you.

**2. Helping others without expecting immediate return**

You contribute to conversations, share resources, make introductions, answer questions. Most of the time, you get nothing back immediately.

**But:** When you eventually need help, people remember you helped them.

**3. Staying visible and top-of-mind**

When someone at OSIsoft says "We need a backend engineer with operations background," your name should come to mind.

**How?** By sharing content, contributing to discussions, showing up consistently.

**4. Learning from others' experiences**

Networking isn't just about getting jobs. It's about:
- Learning which companies have good engineering culture
- Understanding what skills actually matter
- Getting feedback on your portfolio
- Hearing career stories that inform your decisions

**5. Creating luck surface area**

The more people who know you, what you do, and what you're looking for, the more opportunities find their way to you.

**You can't predict where opportunities come from.** Cast a wide net.

### The Reciprocity Principle

**Give before you take. Give more than you take. Give without expecting return.**

**Examples of giving:**

- Answer someone's technical question in Discord
- Share a job posting that's not right for you but might fit someone else
- Introduce two people who should know each other
- Write a thoughtful comment on someone's blog post
- Send a "congratulations" message when someone gets a new job

**You're building social capital.** When you eventually need something (job referral, resume review, informational interview), people will want to help you because you've helped them.

**The 10:1 ratio from Section 20 applies:**

For every 1 ask (job referral, intro, favor), you should have given 10 times (answered questions, made intros, shared resources).

---

## Part 2: Types of Networking

Not all networking is the same. Use different strategies for different situations.

### Warm Networking (Start Here)

**What it is:** Connecting with people you already have something in common with

**Examples:**
- Bootcamp alumni
- MBA classmates
- Veterans in tech groups
- Navy connections who transitioned to tech
- Former Kinder Morgan colleagues who work with software
- People who comment on your blog posts
- Members of communities you're active in (Section 20)

**Why start here:** Warm introductions have built-in trust. You share context.

**Conversion rate:** 60-80% respond positively when you reach out

**How to approach:**

**Message template:**

"Hey [Name], I saw you're working at [Company] as a [Role]. I'm Leo—we were both in [shared context: Navy, bootcamp, community]. I'm transitioning from petroleum operations to software engineering and would love to hear about your experience at [Company]. Would you have 20 minutes for a quick call sometime?"

**Why this works:**
- Shared context (trust)
- Specific ask (20 minutes, not vague "pick your brain")
- Shows you did research (knows their company/role)
- No immediate ask for job (just information)

### Cold Networking (Use Strategically)

**What it is:** Reaching out to people you have no prior connection with

**Examples:**
- Engineers at target companies (OSIsoft, Uptake)
- Authors of blog posts you found helpful
- Speakers from conferences
- Open source maintainers you respect
- Thought leaders in industrial software

**Why it's harder:** No built-in trust. You're a random person in their inbox.

**Conversion rate:** 10-30% respond (much lower than warm)

**How to approach:**

**Message template:**

"Hi [Name],

I came across your post on [specific thing] and it really resonated with my experience transitioning from petroleum operations to software engineering. Your point about [specific detail from their content] especially stood out.

I'm building a library management system with Spring Boot and applying operational patterns I learned managing pipeline SCADA systems. Your content has been genuinely helpful as I learn.

I know you're busy, but if you ever have 15 minutes, I'd love to hear your perspective on [specific question related to their expertise]. No pressure if not—just wanted to say thanks for the valuable content.

Best,
Leo
[Link to your blog/GitHub]"

**Why this might work:**
- References specific content (shows you actually read/watched)
- Explains who you are succinctly (unique background)
- Compliments genuinely (not generic "I admire your work")
- Specific ask with easy out ("no pressure")
- Provides context on you (blog/GitHub link)

**Still, expect 70-90% won't respond. That's normal. Don't take it personally.**

### Strategic Networking (Most Effective Long-Term)

**What it is:** Building relationships with specific people at specific companies you want to work at

**Target list example:**

**Company:** OSIsoft (target company)
**People to connect with:**
- 2-3 backend engineers (learn what they work on)
- 1 engineering manager (understand team structure)
- 1 recruiter (understand hiring process)
- 1 former employee now elsewhere (honest perspective)

**Strategy:** Connect with 5-6 people per target company over 3-6 months

**Why this works:**

When you eventually apply, you're not a random resume. You're:
- "Leo—the guy who's been engaging with our engineering blog"
- "Leo—who asked great questions in our Discord"
- "Leo—who has operations + software background, exactly what we need"

**How to execute:**

**Month 1:** Follow 5-6 people from target company on LinkedIn/Twitter
**Month 2:** Engage with their content (comment thoughtfully on posts)
**Month 3:** Reach out to 1-2 for informational interviews
**Month 4:** Apply with internal referral from someone you've built relationship with

**Conversion rate:** 80%+ because you've built relationship before asking

### Serendipitous Networking (Always On)

**What it is:** Being open to unexpected connections

**Examples:**
- Person sitting next to you at conference
- Someone who comments on your blog post
- Random DM on Twitter from someone with similar background
- Meetup conversation that leads somewhere unexpected

**Strategy:** Always have your 30-second story ready (Section 24). Always follow up with LinkedIn request. Always ask "What are you working on?"

**Best opportunities often come from unexpected places.**

## Part 3: Where to Network

Different platforms, different approaches.

### LinkedIn (Primary Platform)

**Why:** Professional context, recruiters active, searchable, integrated with job applications

**Strategy:**

**1. Complete your profile (Section 2 + 17)**
- Professional headshot
- Headline with "Open Source Contributor" and relevant keywords
- Summary with your flagship story
- Experience emphasizing operational → software transition
- Skills endorsed by connections

**2. Grow connections strategically**

**Target:** 500+ connections in 6 months

**How:**
- Connect with everyone you meet in person (meetups, conferences)
- Connect with bootcamp alumni, MBA classmates
- Connect with people in target companies (5-10 per company)
- Connect with people who engage with your content
- Connect with speakers, open source maintainers, community members

**3. Engage daily (15-20 minutes)**

**Morning routine:**
- Check feed
- Comment thoughtfully on 3-5 posts
- Share article or insight once per week
- Respond to comments on your posts

**What to comment:**
- Not "Great post!" (adds no value)
- Yes "This resonates with my experience managing SCADA systems. We faced similar challenges with [specific thing]. How did you handle [specific question]?" (adds value, starts conversation)

**4. Post weekly (your content from Sections 18-23)**

- Blog posts (technical writing)
- Career insights (thought leadership)
- Milestone celebrations ("Just hit 10 merged PRs to Spring Boot!")
- Questions to your network ("What's your approach to cache invalidation in distributed systems?")

**Goal:** Be visible, helpful, and consistent.

### Twitter/X (Secondary Platform)

**Why:** Real-time, developer community active, thought leaders accessible

**Strategy:**

**1. Follow strategically**

- Engineers at target companies
- Spring Boot / Java thought leaders
- Industrial software / IoT folks
- Career changers documenting their journey
- Technical writers whose content you admire

**Target:** 200-300 follows

**2. Engage first, post second**

**First month:** Reply to others 10x more than you tweet
- Answer questions
- Add insights to discussions
- Quote tweet with your perspective
- Build visibility through engagement

**Second month onward:** Mix of engaging + original content

**3. Tweet 1-2x per day**

- Links to your blog posts
- Quick tips / learnings
- Progress updates (#100DaysOfCode)
- Questions to spark discussion
- Retweets of valuable content with your commentary

**Goal:** Build small engaged audience (500-1,000 followers in 6 months)

### In-Person Events (Highest Quality)

**Why:** Face-to-face builds stronger connections faster

**Strategy:**

**1. Attend 1-2 events per month**

- Local Java User Group (JUG)
- Spring Boot meetup
- Tech talks at coworking spaces
- University tech events (through MBA program)
- Industry conferences (1-2 per year)

**2. Set specific goals per event**

**Not:** "Network with everyone"
**Yes:** "Have meaningful conversations with 3-5 people, exchange LinkedIn with at least 3"

**3. Follow the 3-conversation rule**

**Conversation 1:** Introduce yourself, learn about them (5-10 min)
**Conversation 2:** Deeper discussion if chemistry (10-20 min)
**Conversation 3 (follow-up):** LinkedIn message within 24 hours

**Don't spread thin talking to 20 people for 2 minutes each. Go deep with 3-5.**

### Community Platforms (Discord, Slack)

**Why:** Real-time interaction, easier to help and be helped

**Strategy (from Section 20):**

**1. Join 2-3 active communities**

- Spring Boot Discord
- Java communities
- Career changer / veterans in tech groups

**2. Be consistently helpful**

- Answer questions in your expertise area
- Share resources
- Welcome new members

**3. Build reputation over time**

After 2-3 months of being helpful, people recognize your name. When you eventually ask for referrals or advice, community members want to help.

## Part 4: The Outreach Process

How to actually start conversations.

### Step 1: Research First

**Before reaching out, learn about the person:**

- Read their LinkedIn profile fully
- Check if they have a blog, read 2-3 posts
- Look at their GitHub if they're technical
- See what they post about on LinkedIn/Twitter

**Goal:** Find specific common ground or genuine reason to connect

**Bad reason:** "They work at company I want to work at" (too transactional)

**Good reason:** "They wrote about SCADA integration challenges, which directly relates to my operations background" (genuine shared interest)

### Step 2: Craft Personalized Message

**Template (adapt for context):**

```
Subject: [Specific thing you have in common]

Hi [Name],

I came across your [specific content: post, talk, GitHub project]
on [topic] and [specific thing that resonated/you learned].

I'm Leo—I'm transitioning from petroleum operations (Navy + Kinder
Morgan SCADA systems) to software engineering. I'm particularly
interested in [specific area relevant to them].

[Optional: Share something relevant]
I recently built [brief description of Bibby] and faced similar
challenges you described in [their content].

Would you have 15-20 minutes sometime for a quick call? I'd love to
hear about [specific question related to their experience].

No pressure if you're busy—I know you get a lot of these requests.

Best,
Leo
[LinkedIn profile]
[GitHub]
[Blog if relevant]
```

**Key elements:**

1. **Specific reference** (shows you did research)
2. **Brief context on you** (who you are, why you're reaching out)
3. **Optional value add** (if you have something relevant to share)
4. **Specific, bounded ask** (15-20 min call, not vague "pick your brain")
5. **Easy out** (acknowledges they're busy, removes pressure)
6. **Links** (so they can vet you)

### Step 3: Send and Follow Up

**When to send:**
- **LinkedIn:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9 AM - 11 AM or 2 PM - 4 PM (during work hours)
- **Email:** Same, avoid Monday (too busy) and Friday (weekend mode)
- **Twitter DM:** Anytime, more casual

**Follow-up timeline:**

- **No response in 1 week:** Send polite follow-up
- **No response in 2 weeks:** Move on, try different person at company

**Follow-up template:**

"Hi [Name], following up on my message from last week. Totally understand if you're busy—no worries if now isn't a good time. If you ever have 15 minutes, I'd still love to chat about [topic]. Thanks either way!"

**After follow-up, let it go. Don't be that person who messages 5 times.**

### Step 4: The Conversation

**When they say yes:**

**Before the call:**
- [ ] Research company thoroughly
- [ ] Prepare 5-7 thoughtful questions
- [ ] Review your 60-second story (Section 24)
- [ ] Set up Zoom/Google Meet link if you initiated

**During the call:**

**First 2 minutes:** Brief intros
- "Thanks so much for taking the time. Quick background on me..." [60-second story]
- "I'd love to hear about your journey to [company]"

**Next 15 minutes:** Ask your prepared questions
- About their role, company culture, team structure
- Their career path and decision points
- Advice for someone transitioning like you
- Challenges they've faced, lessons learned

**Last 3 minutes:** Next steps
- Ask if they know anyone else at company you should talk to
- Ask if it's OK to stay in touch
- Ask how you can be helpful to them

**After the call:**
- Send thank-you message within 24 hours
- Connect on LinkedIn if you haven't already
- Follow up with anything you promised to share

### Step 5: Stay in Touch

**Most people fail at networking because they don't stay in touch.**

**Staying in touch is NOT:**
- Messaging every week (too much)
- Only reaching out when you need something (transactional)

**Staying in touch IS:**

- **Comment on their LinkedIn posts** (takes 30 seconds)
- **Share relevant article** with note "Saw this and thought of our conversation about X"
- **Congratulate on promotions/new roles** (LinkedIn notifies you)
- **Update them on your progress** every 2-3 months ("Hey, remember we talked about X? I implemented it in my project and it worked great!")
- **Make introductions** when you can help them

**Frequency:** Touch base every 2-3 months through one of these methods.

**Goal:** When a role opens up at their company 6 months from now, they remember you positively and think "I should refer Leo."

## Part 5: Building Your Target Company List

Strategic networking requires knowing who to network with.

### Creating Your Target List

**Step 1: Identify 10-15 target companies**

Based on your background (operations + industrial software focus):

**Tier 1: Primary targets (industrial software)**
1. OSIsoft (PI System for industrial data)
2. Uptake (industrial AI/predictive maintenance)
3. Rockwell Automation (industrial automation software)
4. Honeywell (industrial control systems)
5. Aveva (industrial software, formerly Wonderware)

**Tier 2: Secondary targets (operational tech companies)**
6. Splunk (operations monitoring, log analytics)
7. Datadog (application monitoring)
8. PagerDuty (incident response)
9. HashiCorp (infrastructure automation)
10. Grafana Labs (observability)

**Tier 3: Backup targets (general tech with ops focus)**
11. Amazon (AWS - cloud infrastructure)
12. Microsoft (Azure - cloud infrastructure)
13. Red Hat (OpenShift, enterprise software)
14. VMware (virtualization, enterprise)
15. Cisco (networking, IoT)

**Step 2: For each target company, identify 5-6 people**

**Use LinkedIn search:**

**Search 1:** "[Company Name] backend engineer" → Find 2-3 individual contributors
**Search 2:** "[Company Name] engineering manager" → Find 1-2 managers
**Search 3:** "[Company Name] recruiter" → Find 1 recruiter

**Export to spreadsheet:**

| Company | Name | Role | LinkedIn | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|------|----------|--------|-------|
| OSIsoft | John Smith | Backend Engineer | [URL] | Researching | Posted about Spring Boot last week |
| OSIsoft | Jane Doe | Engineering Manager | [URL] | Researching | 10 years at company, former ops background |
| OSIsoft | Bob Jones | Technical Recruiter | [URL] | Not yet contacted | |

**Step 3: Prioritize**

**Start with:**
1. People with similar backgrounds (ops → tech, military → tech, career changers)
2. People who are active on LinkedIn/Twitter (more likely to respond)
3. People who've recently posted about topics related to your interests
4. Second or third-degree connections (mutual connection can intro)

**Target:** Connect with 3-5 people per company over 2-3 months

### The 6-Month Networking Plan

**Month 1 (Week 25):**
- Create target company list (10-15 companies)
- Identify 5-6 people per company (50-90 people total)
- Reach out to 10 warm connections (bootcamp, MBA, veteran groups)
- Attend 1 local meetup

**Month 2 (Weeks 26-29):**
- Reach out to 10 strategic connections (target companies)
- Have 3-5 informational interviews
- Post weekly on LinkedIn
- Engage daily on LinkedIn/Twitter
- Attend 1-2 events

**Month 3 (Weeks 30-33):**
- Reach out to 10 more connections (mix of cold/strategic)
- Follow up with Month 1-2 connections
- Apply to 2-3 jobs at target companies (with referrals when possible)
- Continue weekly LinkedIn posts + daily engagement
- Attend 1-2 events

**Month 4-6:**
- Continue pattern: 10 new connections/month
- Maintain relationships with existing connections
- Apply to more roles with warm referrals
- By Month 6: 50-70 genuine connections, 10-15 referrals for jobs

**Result:** Strong network that generates interview opportunities

## Part 6: Networking Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Asking for Job Referral Too Soon

**Wrong sequence:**
1. Connect on LinkedIn
2. Immediately: "Can you refer me for job at [company]?"

**Why it fails:** You haven't built any relationship. They don't know you, don't trust you, won't risk their reputation referring you.

**Right sequence:**
1. Connect, mention something specific you appreciated about their content
2. Have informational interview (learn about company, no ask for job)
3. Stay in touch over 1-2 months (engage with their posts, share relevant things)
4. **Then** ask if they'd be comfortable referring you for specific role

**Timeline:** 1-3 months from first contact to ask for referral

### Mistake 2: Generic, Mass-Sent Messages

**Wrong:**

"Hi! I'm looking for opportunities in software engineering. Can we connect?"

**Why it fails:** Could be sent to anyone. Shows no research, no genuine interest in them specifically.

**Right:**

"Hi [Name], I read your post on managing distributed caches in Spring Boot and your solution to the cache stampede problem was brilliant—we face similar issues in high-concurrency industrial systems. I'm Leo, transitioning from pipeline SCADA operations to backend engineering. Would love to hear more about your experience at [Company]."

**Personalized. Specific. Shows research.**

### Mistake 3: Only Networking When Job Searching

**Wrong pattern:**
- **Months 1-6:** No networking, just building portfolio
- **Month 7:** Suddenly start mass-messaging people for jobs
- **Month 8:** No success, give up on networking

**Why it fails:** Networking is relationship-building, not transaction. You can't build relationships in 1 month when you need them.

**Right pattern:**
- **Months 1-6:** Building portfolio **and** networking in parallel
- **Month 7:** Have relationships in place when you start serious job search
- **Month 8:** Referrals come from relationships you built 3-6 months ago

**Start networking Day 1, not when you're ready to apply for jobs.**

### Mistake 4: Not Following Up

**Wrong:**
- Have great informational interview
- Send thank-you note
- Never contact person again
- 6 months later: "Hey, can you refer me?"

**Why it fails:** They barely remember you. No relationship maintained.

**Right:**
- Have informational interview
- Send thank-you note
- Comment on their LinkedIn posts every few weeks
- Share relevant article 1-2 months later: "Thought of our conversation about X"
- Check in every 2-3 months with updates on your progress
- **Then** ask for referral

**Relationships require maintenance.**

### Mistake 5: Taking Without Giving

**Wrong:**
- Every interaction is you asking for something
- Never help others
- Never share resources or make introductions

**Why it fails:** People see you as transactional user, avoid you

**Right:**
- Maintain 10:1 give/take ratio
- Answer questions in communities
- Make introductions when you can
- Share job postings that aren't right for you
- Celebrate others' wins
- **Then** occasionally ask for help

**Be a giver first, taker second.**

### Mistake 6: Terrible Follow-Up Messages

**Wrong:**

"Hey, just checking in! Any updates?"

**Why it's bad:** Updates on what? Vague, no value provided, feels like you're nagging.

**Right:**

"Hey [Name]! Hope you're well. Quick update: I implemented that cache warming strategy you mentioned in our call—reduced startup time from 45s to 8s! Thank you for that insight. How's the [project they mentioned] going?"

**Provides value (update on advice they gave), shows you acted on their guidance, asks about them.**

### Mistake 7: Networking Only Online

**Wrong:** All networking via LinkedIn messages, never meeting anyone face-to-face

**Why it's limiting:** Face-to-face builds stronger, faster relationships. Zoom calls are middle ground.

**Right:** Mix of online engagement + in-person meetups + video calls

**Goal:** Move best online connections to video calls, move best video call connections to in-person coffee when possible.

## Part 7: Measuring Networking Success

How to know if your networking efforts are working.

### Quantitative Metrics (Track Monthly)

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 3 | Month 6 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| LinkedIn connections | +50 | +150 | +300 |
| Quality connections (had conversations) | 5-10 | 15-25 | 30-50 |
| Informational interviews | 3-5 | 10-15 | 20-30 |
| Referrals received | 0-1 | 2-4 | 5-10 |
| LinkedIn posts | 4 | 12 | 24 |
| Events attended | 1-2 | 3-6 | 6-12 |

**Track in simple spreadsheet. Review monthly.**

### Qualitative Signals

**Your networking is working when:**

**1. Inbound interest increases**
- People reach out to you (not just you reaching out)
- Recruiters InMail you mentioning your background/content
- Community members tag you in relevant discussions

**2. Introductions happen naturally**
- People you've networked with introduce you to others
- "You should meet [Name], they're also in industrial software"
- Your network is growing organically through connections' networks

**3. Referrals become available**
- When you apply, you have internal referral options
- Multiple people at target companies who'd vouch for you
- Hiring managers ask "How do you know [connection]?"

**4. Opportunities find you**
- Job opportunities come via network, not cold applications
- "We have opening, thought of you"
- Companies you didn't even know about reach out

**5. Your questions get answered quickly**
- Post question on LinkedIn → 10+ helpful responses
- Ask in community → multiple people help
- Your network is reciprocating

**If these are happening, your networking is effective.**

### The Network Strength Test

**Test your network quarterly:**

**Post on LinkedIn:**
"I'm looking for insights on [specific technical question or company question]. Anyone have experience with this?"

**Strong network:** 10+ thoughtful responses within 24 hours
**Weak network:** 0-2 responses or only generic comments

**If weak, you need to:**
- Engage more consistently with others' content
- Provide more value before asking
- Build more genuine relationships (not just connections)

---

## Part 8: Time Management for Networking

Networking can consume infinite time. Set boundaries.

### Weekly Time Budget

**Total networking time: 5-7 hours/week**

**Breakdown:**

**LinkedIn engagement (30 min/day, 3.5 hours/week):**
- Morning: Check feed, comment on 3-5 posts (15 min)
- Afternoon: Respond to comments on your posts (5 min)
- Evening: Send 1-2 connection requests or messages (10 min)

**Content creation (2 hours/week):**
- Write LinkedIn post (1 hour, once per week)
- Engage with responses (1 hour spread through week)

**Informational interviews (1-2 hours/week):**
- 1-2 calls per week, 20-30 min each
- Prep before (15 min)
- Follow-up after (15 min)

**In-person events (2-3 hours/month, ~30 min/week average):**
- 1-2 meetups per month
- Face-to-face is highest ROI but time-intensive

**Community engagement (1 hour/week):**
- Discord/Slack daily check-ins (10 min/day)
- Answering questions, staying visible

**Your total weekly workload (Week 25):**
- Technical work on Bibby: 5-8 hours
- Writing: 6-8 hours (Section 18)
- Community: 3-5 hours (Section 20)
- Networking: 5-7 hours (Section 25)
- **Total: 19-28 hours/week**

**If working full-time + MBA, this is upper limit. Adjust as needed.**

### Batching Networking Activities

**Don't:** Check LinkedIn 10 times a day, context switch constantly

**Do:** Batch networking into specific time blocks

**Sample schedule:**

**Monday morning (30 min): Networking planning**
- Review target company list
- Identify 5 people to reach out to this week
- Draft personalized messages

**Daily (15 min morning, 15 min evening): LinkedIn engagement**
- Morning: Comment on 3-5 posts
- Evening: Send 1-2 connection messages

**Wednesday (1 hour): Content creation**
- Write LinkedIn post
- Schedule for Thursday morning

**Thursday/Friday (1-2 hours): Informational interviews**
- 1-2 scheduled calls
- Prep + call + follow-up

**Saturday (1 hour): Catch-up and reflection**
- Review week's networking
- Update tracking spreadsheet
- Plan next week

**Result:** Consistent presence without constant context switching

## Conclusion: Networking Is a Long Game

You won't see immediate results from networking. That's OK.

**The timeline:**

**Month 1:** Feels awkward, few responses, questioning if it works
**Month 2:** Starting to get responses, a few good conversations
**Month 3:** Network effects kick in—introductions happen, visibility increases
**Month 6:** Opportunities coming via network, referrals available
**Month 12:** Network sustains itself—giving and receiving flows naturally

**Networking is compound interest for your career.**

Early investments (reaching out, helping others, showing up consistently) pay dividends months later when you need them.

**The key differentiator:**

**Most people network only when desperate for job.**

**You network consistently from Day 1.**

**When you start job search in Month 6-9, you have:**
- 300+ LinkedIn connections (not 50)
- 30-50 genuine relationships (not 5)
- 10-20 potential referrals (not 0)
- Warm introductions to target companies (not cold applications)

**That's how career changers without traditional networks compete.**

**Week 25 success = Target list created, 10 warm connections reached out to, first informational interview completed, LinkedIn optimized and actively engaged.**

Networking feels unnatural at first. Do it anyway. Your future self—the one getting interviews and job offers—will thank you.

**70-85% of jobs come through networking. Don't ignore the channel that matters most.**

Build the network now. Reap the rewards later.
