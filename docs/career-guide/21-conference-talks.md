# Section 21: Conference Talks

**Week 21 Focus:** Preparing and Delivering Technical Presentations

---

## Introduction: Why Speaking Matters

Public speaking terrifies most developers. That's your opportunity.

**The speaking advantage:**

1. **Instant credibility:** Speakers are perceived as experts, even if they're early in their careers
2. **Visibility multiplier:** A 20-minute talk reaches 50-200 people simultaneously (vs 1-on-1 networking)
3. **Content creation:** One talk becomes blog post, video, social media content
4. **Network acceleration:** Audience members approach you after, LinkedIn requests flood in
5. **Job pipeline:** Recruiters attend meetups specifically to find speakers

**The career changer edge:**

Your operational background makes you a compelling speaker. "Former Navy petroleum technician talks about building reliable software" is infinitely more interesting than "Generic developer talks about Spring Boot."

**The fear is real, but:**

- First talk is terrifying. Fifth talk is comfortable. Tenth talk is enjoyable.
- You're not competing with conference keynote speakers. You're sharing what you learned.
- Audiences want you to succeed. They're rooting for you.

**This week's mission:** Prepare your first technical talk, find venues to deliver it, practice until confident, and establish yourself as someone who teaches what they learn.

## Part 1: Types of Speaking Opportunities

Start small, scale up.

### Level 1: Local Meetups (Start Here)

**What it is:** 15-30 minute talks at local developer meetups

**Audience size:** 20-50 people (sometimes 5-10 if small group)

**Examples:**
- Local Java User Group (JUG)
- Spring Boot meetup
- University tech club
- Coworking space tech talks

**Difficulty:** Low-medium
- Friendly audiences (developers helping developers)
- Forgiving of nervousness
- Q&A is conversational, not adversarial

**How to get speaking slot:**
- Email organizer: "I'd like to present on [topic]. Here's a brief abstract."
- Most meetups struggle to find speakers—you'll likely get yes
- Propose specific date 4-8 weeks out

**Time commitment:**
- Prep: 10-15 hours (first talk takes longer)
- Deliver: 2-3 hours (event + networking)

**ROI:** High for beginners
- Local networking
- Practice for bigger stages
- Video recording for portfolio

**Your first talk should be at a local meetup.**

### Level 2: Virtual Meetups and Webinars

**What it is:** Online presentations via Zoom, Google Meet, etc.

**Audience size:** 30-100 people (sometimes more)

**Examples:**
- Virtual JUGs
- Online bootcamp alumni events
- Discord community presentations
- LinkedIn Live sessions

**Difficulty:** Low-medium
- No in-person anxiety (present from home)
- Can have notes visible
- Recording distributed afterward

**Advantages over in-person:**
- No travel
- Wider geographic reach
- Easier to practice (can do dry run)
- Less intimidating (no physical audience staring)

**Disadvantages:**
- Harder to read audience energy
- Technical issues (internet, audio, screen sharing)
- Less networking (Zoom chat vs face-to-face)

**How to get speaking slot:**
- Same as local meetups—email organizers
- Offer to pre-record if they prefer

**Time commitment:**
- Prep: 10-15 hours
- Deliver: 1-2 hours

**ROI:** Medium-high
- Broader reach than local
- Recording lives forever
- Global audience potential

### Level 3: Regional Conferences

**What it is:** Multi-track conferences with 200-1,000 attendees

**Examples:**
- DevNexus (Atlanta)
- CodeMash (Ohio)
- NDC (various cities)
- Regional Java conferences

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Talk format:**
- 45-60 minute sessions
- Submitted via CFP (Call for Proposals)
- 3-6 months lead time

**How to get accepted:**
- Submit strong proposal to CFP
- Acceptance rate: 20-40% (competitive but achievable)
- First-time speakers often favored (diversity programs)

**Time commitment:**
- Prep: 20-30 hours (more polished than meetup talk)
- Deliver: 2-3 days (conference attendance + travel)

**ROI:** High
- Career credibility boost
- Recruiter magnet
- Video recording with production quality
- Networking with hundreds

**Aim for this by Month 6-9 (after 3-5 meetup talks).**

### Level 4: Major Conferences (Long-Term Goal)

**What it is:** National/international conferences with 1,000-10,000 attendees

**Examples:**
- SpringOne
- JavaOne / Oracle Code One
- QCon
- GOTO

**Difficulty:** High

**Talk format:**
- 45-60 minutes, highly polished
- CFP acceptance rate: 5-15% (very competitive)
- 6-12 months lead time

**How to get accepted:**
- Established speaking record (5-10 talks)
- Unique perspective or cutting-edge topic
- Well-known in community

**Time commitment:**
- Prep: 30-50 hours
- Deliver: 3-5 days (conference + travel)

**ROI:** Very high
- Major career milestone
- International visibility
- Speaking fee often included
- Permanent career credential

**This is Year 2-3 goal. Don't start here.**

### Level 5: Lightning Talks (Easiest Entry Point)

**What it is:** 5-10 minute rapid-fire talks at meetups or conferences

**Format:**
- Very short (5 slides, 5 minutes typical)
- Less formal than full talks
- Often "open mic" style at end of meetups

**Difficulty:** Low

**Why start here:**
- Low time investment (2-3 hours prep)
- Less intimidating (short = less can go wrong)
- Audience expectations lower
- Great practice for longer talks

**Topics:**
- "One weird trick" you learned
- Quick tool demo
- Brief war story from project
- Single concept explained clearly

**Example lightning talk for Leo:**
"5 Minutes: What Pipeline SCADA Taught Me About API Monitoring"

**How to get slot:**
- Ask meetup organizer if they do lightning talks
- Often same-day sign-up (no proposal needed)

**Consider doing 2-3 lightning talks before first full talk.**

## Part 2: Choosing Your Talk Topic

Good topic = overlap of three circles:

1. **You know it well** (implemented it, struggled with it, solved it)
2. **Audience cares** (solves their problems, teaches something valuable)
3. **Differentiated** (not the 50th "Introduction to Docker" talk)

### Topic Brainstorming Framework

**The "War Story" Talk**

Share a real problem you solved.

**Formula:** "How I [solved problem] at [company/project] using [technology]"

**Examples for Leo:**
- "How I Reduced Spring Boot API Response Time from 2s to 40ms Using Redis"
- "Refactoring a 200-Line Controller: Lessons from Real Code"
- "Building Real-Time Analytics: What SCADA Systems Taught Me"

**Why it works:**
- You have firsthand experience (credibility)
- Real problems are relatable (audience has similar issues)
- Concrete metrics (2s → 40ms) prove value

**The "Career Journey" Talk**

Share your transition story.

**Formula:** "From [old career] to [new career]: What I Learned"

**Examples for Leo:**
- "From Pipeline Operations to Software Engineering: Lessons from Career Change"
- "What Navy Petroleum Systems Taught Me About Reliable Software"
- "Building Your First Portfolio Project as a Career Changer"

**Why it works:**
- Unique to you (no one else has your story)
- Inspirational (helps others in similar position)
- Humanizing (people connect with personal stories)

**The "Deep Dive" Talk**

Explain a complex topic thoroughly.

**Formula:** "[Complex topic] Explained: [Framework/Approach]"

**Examples for Leo:**
- "JPA N+1 Queries: Detection, Fixes, and Prevention"
- "Spring Boot Caching Strategies: Redis, Caffeine, and Beyond"
- "Database Design for Domain-Driven Design in Spring Boot"

**Why it works:**
- Demonstrates deep expertise
- Evergreen content (always relevant)
- SEO-friendly (people search for these topics)

**The "Comparison" Talk**

Compare approaches, technologies, or patterns.

**Formula:** "[Option A] vs [Option B]: When to Use Each"

**Examples for Leo:**
- "JPA vs JDBC: When to Use Each in Spring Boot"
- "Monolith vs Microservices: A Pragmatic Perspective for SMBs"
- "REST vs GraphQL for Backend APIs"

**Why it works:**
- Helps audience make decisions
- Nuanced (not "X is always better")
- Demonstrates breadth of knowledge

**The "Anti-Pattern" Talk**

Show common mistakes and how to avoid them.

**Formula:** "[X] Mistakes I Made [Building Y] and How to Avoid Them"

**Examples for Leo:**
- "5 Spring Boot Mistakes I Made Building Bibby (and How to Fix Them)"
- "Database Performance Anti-Patterns in JPA"
- "Portfolio Project Mistakes That Cost Me Interviews"

**Why it works:**
- Honesty is refreshing (not positioning as guru)
- Practical (audience avoids your mistakes)
- Memorable (people remember failures more than successes)

### Topic Selection Criteria

**For your first talk, choose a topic that:**

1. **You've implemented** (can demo real code, not just theory)
2. **Took you 10-20 hours to learn** (not trivial, not overwhelming)
3. **Surprised you when you learned it** (if it surprised you, it'll surprise others)
4. **Has clear before/after** (metrics, screenshots, code comparison)
5. **Solves a pain point** (audience leaves knowing how to fix a problem)

**Leo's strongest first talk options:**

**Option A: "Spring Boot + Redis Caching: 40x Performance Improvement"**
- You implemented it in Bibby
- Clear metrics (2s → 40ms)
- Solves common pain point (slow APIs)
- Can demo actual code
- 20-minute talk fits meetup format

**Option B: "From Pipeline Operations to Software: What Transfers"**
- Unique to your story
- Helps career changers
- Inspirational + practical
- No code required (easier first talk)
- 25-minute talk with Q&A

**Option C: "Building Analytics Dashboards: Lessons from SCADA"**
- Bridges operational background with code
- Differentiated (SCADA → software angle)
- Can show Bibby dashboard demo
- 30-minute talk with live demo

**Recommendation: Start with Option A (Redis caching).**

**Why:**
- Most concrete (clear problem → solution → result)
- Demo-friendly (show code, show performance)
- Fits blog post you already wrote (Section 18, Article 1)
- Technical credibility (proves you can build)

**Option B makes great second talk (different audience: career changers vs technical).**

## Part 3: Creating Your Slide Deck

Slides support your talk, they're not your talk.

### Slide Deck Principles

**1. One idea per slide**

**Bad:** Slide with 5 bullet points, each a different concept
**Good:** Slide with one concept, one visual, one takeaway

**2. Minimal text**

**Bad:** Paragraph of text on slide (you read it word-for-word)
**Good:** 5-7 words maximum, big font, you explain verbally

**Rule:** If audience can read slide faster than you can speak it, too much text.

**3. High contrast and legibility**

**Bad:** Light gray text on white background
**Good:** Dark text on light background, or white text on dark background

**Font size minimum:** 24pt for body text, 36pt+ for headers

**Test:** Can you read slide from 10 feet away? If no, too small.

**4. Visuals over words**

**Instead of text list, use:**
- Code screenshots (syntax highlighted)
- Diagrams (architecture, flow, sequence)
- Charts (performance before/after)
- Photos (your face, demo screenshots)
- Icons (to illustrate concepts)

**5. Consistent design**

Use template. Don't mix 5 different fonts and color schemes.

**Free templates:**
- Google Slides templates (built-in)
- SlidesGo (free, modern designs)
- Canva presentation templates

**Or keep it simple:** White background, black text, one accent color.

### Standard Talk Structure (20-30 Minutes)

**Slide 1: Title Slide (30 seconds)**

```
Title: Spring Boot + Redis Caching: 40x Performance Improvement

Your Name
Your Title/Project
Date & Event
```

Include:
- Your name (big and clear)
- Your headshot (optional but humanizing)
- Twitter/LinkedIn handle (so people can find you)

**Slide 2-3: Who Am I? (1-2 minutes)**

Establish credibility briefly.

```
Slide 2: Who Am I?

• Former Navy petroleum systems technician (4 years)
• Pipeline SCADA operator at Kinder Morgan (5 years)
• Now: Software engineer building Bibby (library management system)
• Passionate about operational reliability in code

[Photo of you or relevant background]
```

**Why this matters:**
- Operational background → credibility on reliability
- Real-world project → not just theory
- Career changer → relatable to many in audience

**Keep it brief.** Don't spend 5 minutes on bio. Get to content fast.

**Slide 4-5: The Problem (2-3 minutes)**

Set up the pain point.

```
Slide 4: The Problem

Bibby analytics dashboard was SLOW

• Query time: 2+ seconds
• Aggregate queries across 100K+ records
• Poor user experience
• Unacceptable for operational monitoring

[Screenshot of slow loading spinner]
```

```
Slide 5: Why This Matters

In pipeline operations, SCADA updates every 100ms.

2 seconds feels broken.

[Image of SCADA display or pipeline control room]
```

**Make the problem visceral.** Audience should feel the pain.

**Slide 6-8: The Solution Overview (3-5 minutes)**

Introduce your approach at high level.

```
Slide 6: The Solution

Add caching layer with Redis

• Cache expensive queries
• Set appropriate TTL (time-to-live)
• Invalidate cache on writes
• Result: 40x faster

[Simple diagram: API → Redis → PostgreSQL]
```

```
Slide 7: Architecture Before

[Diagram showing direct API → PostgreSQL queries]
```

```
Slide 8: Architecture After

[Diagram showing API → Redis (cache hit) → PostgreSQL (cache miss)]
```

**Visual diagrams >>> bullet points** for architecture.

**Slide 9-15: Implementation Details (10-12 minutes)**

This is the meat. Show code, explain decisions.

```
Slide 9: Step 1 - Add Redis Dependency

[Code screenshot of pom.xml with Redis dependency]
```

```
Slide 10: Step 2 - Configure Redis

[Code screenshot of application.yml Redis config]
```

```
Slide 11: Step 3 - Annotate Methods

[Code screenshot of @Cacheable annotation on service method]

@Cacheable(value = "analyticsCache", key = "#root.methodName")
public AnalyticsSummaryDTO getAnalyticsSummary() {
    // expensive query
}
```

```
Slide 12: The Hard Part - Cache Invalidation

There are only two hard things in Computer Science:
cache invalidation and naming things.
— Phil Karlton

[This is a great slide - humor + truth]
```

```
Slide 13: Invalidating on Writes

[Code screenshot of @CacheEvict on write operations]

@CacheEvict(value = "analyticsCache", allEntries = true)
public void createCheckout(CheckoutEntity checkout) {
    checkoutRepository.save(checkout);
}
```

**Intersperse code with explanations:**

Don't show 7 code slides in a row. Show code → explain why → show result → next code.

**Slide 16-18: Results and Metrics (3-4 minutes)**

Prove it worked.

```
Slide 16: Performance Improvement

Before: 2,000ms average response time
After: 40ms average response time

50x improvement!

[Bar chart showing dramatic difference]
```

```
Slide 17: Trade-offs

Pro:
• Massively faster response
• Better user experience
• Lower database load

Con:
• Stale data (up to 1 hour)
• Added complexity (cache invalidation)
• Redis dependency (one more thing to manage)

[Nothing is free. Acknowledge trade-offs.]
```

**Slide 19-20: Key Takeaways (2-3 minutes)**

Summarize what audience should remember.

```
Slide 19: When to Use Redis Caching

✅ Expensive queries (aggregations, joins)
✅ Read-heavy workloads
✅ Data that changes infrequently

❌ User-specific data (security risk)
❌ Data that changes constantly
❌ Simple queries (overhead not worth it)
```

```
Slide 20: Key Takeaways

1. Cache expensive queries, measure improvement
2. Set appropriate TTL based on your use case
3. Don't forget cache invalidation (the hard part)
4. Monitor cache hit rate

## Part 4: Presentation Skills and Delivery

Content is 50%. Delivery is the other 50%.

### Voice and Energy

**1. Speak slower than normal**

When nervous, you speed up. Consciously slow down.

**Practice:** Record yourself. Play back. If it feels "too slow" to you, it's probably right pace for audience.

**2. Project your voice**

Speak to back of room, not first row.

**Practice:** Present to empty room, imagine person in back corner. Speak loud enough for them.

**3. Vary your inflection**

Monotone = audience falls asleep.

**Bad:** "And then I added Redis. And then I configured it. And then I tested it."
**Good:** "So Redis was the answer. [pause] But! [emphasis] Configuring it was tricky..."

**Practice:** Read children's book aloud with exaggerated emotion. Feels silly, but trains inflection.

**4. Pause strategically**

Silence is powerful.

**Use pauses:**
- After asking rhetorical question (let it land)
- Before revealing important point (builds anticipation)
- After making joke (give audience time to laugh)
- When advancing to new topic (signals transition)

**Don't fear silence.** 3-second pause feels like eternity to you, feels natural to audience.

**5. Energy level: 20% higher than conversation**

What feels like "too much" energy to you reads as "engaged and enthusiastic" to audience.

**Practice:** Present to friend. Ask them: "Did I seem energetic or flat?" Adjust.

### Body Language

**1. Stand still (mostly)**

**Nervous habit:** Pacing, swaying, shifting weight

**Better:** Plant feet shoulder-width, stay grounded. Move purposefully when you do move.

**OK to move:** Walking to other side of stage when transitioning topics. Not OK: Pacing back and forth while talking.

**2. Use hand gestures (naturally)**

**Nervous habit:** Hands in pockets, arms crossed, clutching podium

**Better:** Hands at waist level, use gestures to emphasize points

**Good gestures:**
- Open hands when explaining concept
- Counting on fingers for lists
- Pointing to slide (then back to audience)

**Bad gestures:**
- Repetitive (same gesture every 10 seconds)
- Distracting (fidgeting with clicker)

**3. Make eye contact**

**Nervous habit:** Staring at slides, looking at floor, looking at notes

**Better:** Look at different people in audience (3-5 seconds each)

**Technique:** Divide room into quadrants. Spend time in each quadrant throughout talk.

**If too nervous for real eye contact:** Look at foreheads. They can't tell difference from back of room.

**4. Smile (when appropriate)**

You're sharing something you learned. That's exciting! Your face should show it.

**Not:** Forced smile entire time (creepy)
**Yes:** Natural smile when introducing yourself, thanking audience, sharing wins

### Handling Nerves

**Everyone is nervous. Even experienced speakers.**

**Before talk:**

1. **Deep breathing** (4 seconds in, 6 seconds out, repeat 10 times)
2. **Physical warmup** (stretch, jump, shake out tension)
3. **Vocal warmup** (hum, tongue twisters, speak first slide aloud)
4. **Power pose** (stand in confident pose 2 minutes - actually works per research)
5. **Reframe anxiety as excitement** ("I'm excited" vs "I'm nervous" - your body can't tell difference)

**During talk:**

1. **Focus on first 3 slides** (once you get through opening, nerves calm)
2. **Have water nearby** (dry mouth is common, take sip when needed)
3. **Pause and breathe** (if you lose your place, stop, breathe, check notes, continue)
4. **Remember: Audience wants you to succeed** (they're not judging, they're learning)

**If you blank:**

"Let me check my notes real quick" → totally fine, audience understands

**Don't:** Apologize profusely ("Sorry, I'm so nervous, sorry...")

**Do:** Acknowledge briefly ("Bear with me for a second") and move on

---

## Part 5: Practice and Rehearsal

**No one delivers a great talk without practice. No one.**

### Practice Schedule (3 Weeks Out)

**Week 1: Build deck and script**
- Create slides (8-10 hours)
- Write speaker notes for each slide (2-3 hours)
- Practice alone, reading notes (1 hour)

**Week 2: Rehearse and refine**
- Practice full talk alone, timing yourself (3-5 run-throughs, ~2 hours)
- Record yourself on video, watch, cringe, improve (1 hour)
- Practice for friend or spouse (1 hour)
- Revise slides based on feedback (1-2 hours)

**Week 3: Polish**
- Practice without notes (2-3 run-throughs)
- Practice in front of mirror or record again (1 hour)
- Final practice day before talk (1 hour)

**Total practice time: 12-18 hours**

**This feels like a lot. It is. But first talk takes most work. Fifth talk takes half as much.**

### Practice Techniques

**1. Practice aloud (not just mentally)**

**Doesn't count:** Reading slides in your head

**Counts:** Speaking out loud, full voice, as if presenting

**Why:** Muscle memory. Your mouth needs to practice words.

**2. Practice with timer**

Set timer for your talk length (e.g., 25 minutes).

**First few practice runs:** Probably go long (30-35 minutes). That's normal.

**Fix:** Cut content or speed up slightly (not too fast - clarity > time).

**Goal:** Finish with 2-3 minutes buffer (for Q&A or if you go slightly long).

**3. Record yourself**

**Video record practice run. Watch it. You'll hate it. Watch anyway.**

**What to look for:**
- Verbal tics ("um," "uh," "like," "so")
- Pacing (too fast? too slow?)
- Energy (flat? too hyper?)
- Clarity (can you understand yourself?)

**Don't aim for perfection.** Aim for "good enough."

**4. Practice Q&A**

**After practice run, imagine 3-5 questions audience might ask.**

**For caching talk:**
- "What if my data changes more frequently than 1 hour?"
- "Why Redis instead of in-memory caching?"
- "How do you monitor cache hit rate?"
- "What's the performance overhead of Redis itself?"

**Practice answering aloud.** Have 1-2 sentence answers ready.

**It's OK to say:**
- "Great question. I haven't tested that scenario yet."
- "I'm not sure. Let's connect after and I can look into it."
- "That's outside scope of this talk, but [brief relevant comment]."

### Dry Run with Audience

**1-2 weeks before talk, present to small audience (5-10 people).**

**Audience options:**
- Coworkers
- Study group
- Discord community (virtual)
- Spouse + friends

**Ask for specific feedback:**
- "Was anything confusing?"
- "Did I go too fast or too slow?"
- "Which parts were most/least interesting?"
- "What questions do you have?"

**Don't ask:** "Was it good?" (too vague)

**Incorporate feedback:**
- 2-3 people confused by same thing → revise that slide
- Someone asks great question → add slide addressing it
- Timing off → cut or add content

---

## Part 6: Day-of and Delivering the Talk

**You've practiced. Now perform.**

### Pre-Talk Checklist (Day Before)

- [ ] Slides finalized and uploaded to Google Drive (backup)
- [ ] Slides on USB drive (backup for backup)
- [ ] Laptop charged
- [ ] Presentation mode tested (extend display, not mirror)
- [ ] Demo code ready (if live coding)
- [ ] Clicker batteries fresh (if using remote)
- [ ] Speaker notes printed (optional backup)
- [ ] Outfit chosen (business casual, comfortable)
- [ ] Water bottle packed
- [ ] Arrive time planned (30 min early)

### Pre-Talk Routine (30 Minutes Before)

**When you arrive:**

1. **Introduce yourself to organizer** ("Hi, I'm Leo, speaking today")
2. **Test A/V setup:**
   - Plug in laptop
   - Test slides advance
   - Test any videos/animations
   - Test microphone if provided
   - Check font size from back of room
3. **Set up your space:**
   - Water nearby
   - Clicker in hand
   - Laptop positioned where you can see (but audience focus on screen)
4. **Bathroom break** (nervous = need to pee)
5. **Final vocal warmup** (hum quietly, warm up voice)
6. **Deep breathing** (calm nerves)
7. **Review first 3 slides** (nail the opening)

### During the Talk: Opening (First 3 Minutes)

**The opening sets the tone. Nail this and rest flows.**

**1. Wait for audience attention**

Don't start while people are chatting.

**Organizer introduces you → wait for applause to die → pause 2 seconds → begin.**

**2. Make eye contact and smile**

**First words:**

"Hi everyone, I'm Leo. Thanks for having me."

**Pause. Smile. Breathe.**

"How many of you have built a Spring Boot API that was too slow?"

**Show of hands → engagement → you're off to strong start.**

**3. Establish credibility quickly**

"I'm a former pipeline operator turned software engineer. I spent 5 years managing SCADA systems where sub-second response time wasn't optional—it was critical. So when my Bibby analytics dashboard took 2 seconds to load, I knew I had to fix it."

**In 30 seconds:**
- Credibility (operations background)
- Relatability (career changer)
- Problem setup (slow API)

**Audience is now interested.**

**4. Set expectations**

"Today I'm going to show you how I used Redis caching to reduce that 2-second response time to 40 milliseconds. I'll show the code, the architecture decisions, and the trade-offs. By the end, you'll know when caching helps and when it doesn't."

**Audience now knows:**
- What they'll learn
- How long it'll take
- What value they'll get

**Now you're 3 minutes in, nerves have calmed, you're in the flow.**

### During the Talk: Middle (Slides 6-18)

**This is your content. You've practiced this. Trust your preparation.**

**Tips:**

**1. Advance slides smoothly**

Don't click too fast (feels rushed). Don't wait too long (feels uncertain).

**Rhythm:** Make point → pause 2 seconds → advance slide → make next point.

**2. Face audience, not screen**

**Common mistake:** Turning back to audience to read slide.

**Better:** Glance at laptop screen in front of you (set to presenter mode), speak to audience.

**3. Explain code clearly**

When showing code slide:

"Here on line 3, you see the @Cacheable annotation. This tells Spring Boot to check Redis before executing the method."

**Point at screen** (or use laser pointer if available).

**Read critical code aloud** (don't assume everyone can read from back).

**4. Check the time**

Glance at watch or phone (set nearby).

**At halfway point:** Should be roughly halfway through slides.

**If running long:** Skip optional slides or speed up slightly.

**If running short:** Elaborate more on key points (better than finishing 10 minutes early).

**5. Read the room**

**Signs of engagement:**
- Nodding heads
- Note-taking
- Eye contact
- Leaning forward

**Signs of losing them:**
- Checking phones
- Glazed looks
- Whispered conversations

**If losing them:**
- Pick up pace
- Add unexpected element (humor, ask question)
- Skip less important slide

### During the Talk: Closing (Last 3 Minutes)

**End strong.**

**1. Summarize key takeaways (Slide 19-20)**

"So to recap: Redis caching works great for expensive queries and read-heavy workloads. Set appropriate TTL, don't forget cache invalidation, and always measure the improvement."

**2. Call to action**

"All the code for this is on GitHub at github.com/yourname/bibby. If you want to connect, I'm on LinkedIn and Twitter—handles are on the screen. I'd love to hear if you try this approach."

**3. Thank audience and invite questions**

"Thanks so much for your attention. I'd love to take questions."

**Pause. Wait for hands.**

### Handling Q&A

**Q&A can make or break the talk.**

**1. Repeat the question**

**Why:** Remote attendees can't hear, keeps you in control, gives you time to think.

**Format:**

Audience member: "[Inaudible question]"

You: "Great question. You're asking about what happens when data changes more frequently than the TTL, right?"

**Then answer.**

**2. Answer concisely**

**Bad:** 5-minute answer that's really a second talk

**Good:** 1-2 minute answer, direct and clear

**If long answer needed:** "That's a deep question. Short answer is [X]. I'm happy to discuss more after—come find me."

**3. Be honest about what you don't know**

**Someone asks advanced question you can't answer.**

**Bad:** Making up answer or deflecting awkwardly

**Good:** "That's a great question. I haven't gone deep on that yet. Do you have experience with it? [turn it into conversation]"

**Or:** "I don't know, but I'd love to look into it. Let's connect after and I can follow up."

**Honesty builds trust.**

**4. Handle challenging questions gracefully**

**Occasionally someone asks question that challenges your approach.**

"Why didn't you just use Caffeine instead of Redis?"

**Bad:** Defensive ("Well, Redis is obviously better...")

**Good:** "That's a fair point. Caffeine would work well for in-memory caching. I chose Redis because I wanted distributed caching for future horizontal scaling. But for single-instance apps, Caffeine is great choice."

**Acknowledge validity, explain your reasoning, validate their alternative.**

**5. End Q&A on your terms**

After 3-5 questions:

"I see we're at time. I'm happy to take more questions afterward—come grab me! Thanks again."

**Take control. Don't let Q&A drag on awkwardly.**

## Part 7: After the Talk

**The talk doesn't end when you finish speaking.**

### Immediate Post-Talk (5-30 Minutes After)

**1. Stick around and be accessible**

**Don't:** Pack up laptop and leave immediately.

**Do:** Stay for 15-30 minutes, chat with attendees who approach.

**Common post-talk conversations:**
- "Great talk! I have a follow-up question..."
- "I'm also a career changer, can I pick your brain?"
- "We're hiring at [company], are you open to opportunities?"

**These conversations are gold. Be present.**

**2. Exchange contact info**

When someone wants to connect:

"Let's connect on LinkedIn—here's my card/QR code."

**Or:** "What's your LinkedIn? I'll send you a request tonight."

**Follow up within 24 hours.**

**3. Gather feedback**

Ask 3-5 people:

"Hey, can I get your quick feedback? What landed well? What could be clearer?"

**Take notes.** Use for next talk.

### Follow-Up (24-48 Hours After)

**1. Send LinkedIn requests to people you met**

**Message template:**

"Great meeting you at the [Meetup Name] talk yesterday! Enjoyed chatting about [specific thing]. Let's keep in touch."

**Personalize each one.** No copy-paste.

**2. Thank the organizer**

Email or LinkedIn message:

"Thanks so much for the opportunity to speak at [Meetup Name]! Really enjoyed it. If the recording turns out, I'd love a copy. Happy to speak again anytime."

**Organizers remember speakers who are gracious.** Next speaking opportunity may come from them.

**3. Request video/slides if applicable**

If talk was recorded:

"Could you share the video when it's ready? I'd like to post it on LinkedIn."

**4. Share slides publicly**

**Post slides to:**
- SlideShare or SpeakerDeck (slide hosting)
- Your blog (embed slides)
- LinkedIn post
- Twitter/X

**LinkedIn post template:**

"Had a great time speaking at [Meetup Name] yesterday about Redis caching in Spring Boot!

Key takeaway: We reduced API response time from 2s to 40ms with simple caching strategy.

### Repurpose the Content

**One talk → multiple content pieces:**

1. **Blog post** (you may have already written this - Section 18)
2. **Video** (if talk was recorded)
3. **Twitter thread** (key points from talk)
4. **LinkedIn article** (expanded version)
5. **Slide deck** (published on SlideShare)
6. **GitHub repo** (demo code from talk)

**You spent 15-20 hours preparing. Squeeze every drop of value from it.**

## Part 8: Finding Speaking Opportunities

**How to get invited to speak.**

### Finding Local Meetups

**1. Meetup.com**

Search "[Your City] Java User Group", "Spring Boot", "Software Engineering"

**Look for:**
- Active groups (events in last 2 months)
- Reasonable size (15-50 attendees ideal for first talk)
- Speaker-focused format (not just networking)

**2. Google**

Search "Java User Group [Your City]"

Many JUGs have websites outside Meetup.com.

**3. LinkedIn**

Search LinkedIn for local tech groups, post asking:

"Does anyone know of a Java or Spring Boot meetup in [City]? I'd like to give a talk on Redis caching."

**4. Twitter/X**

Tweet:

"Looking for Java/Spring Boot meetup in [City] where I could present on caching strategies. Know of any? #Java #SpringBoot"

**Community will respond with suggestions.**

**5. Universities**

If you're doing MBA, check if university has:
- Computer science club
- Tech entrepreneurship group
- Coding bootcamp partnerships

**Student groups always need speakers.**

### Pitching Your Talk

**Once you find meetup, pitch the organizer.**

**Email template:**

```
Subject: Speaking proposal: Spring Boot + Redis Caching

Hi [Organizer Name],

I'm Leo, a software engineer in [City]. I've been following [Meetup Name]
for a few months and would love to present.

Proposed talk: "Spring Boot + Redis Caching: 40x Performance Improvement"

Abstract:
When I built the analytics dashboard for my library management system,
initial queries took 2+ seconds. By adding Redis caching with Spring
Boot's @Cacheable annotation, I reduced response time to 40ms—a 40x
improvement.

This 25-minute talk covers:
• When caching helps (and when it doesn't)
• Implementing Redis with Spring Boot (with code examples)
• Cache invalidation strategies
• Performance testing and metrics

I'm a former pipeline operator turned software engineer, and I bring an
operational reliability perspective to building backend systems.

I'm available [list 2-3 dates/months]. Let me know if this would be a
good fit for the group!

Thanks,
Leo [Last Name]

Blog: blog.yourname.com
GitHub: github.com/yourname
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/yourname
```

**Why this works:**

1. **Specific topic** (not "I can talk about anything")
2. **Clear value** (40x improvement = concrete)
3. **Agenda** (organizer knows what to expect)
4. **Credibility** (operational background differentiation)
5. **Flexibility** (you accommodate their schedule)
6. **Contact info** (they can vet you)

**Response rate: 60-80%** (meetups need speakers desperately)

### Submitting to Conference CFPs

**CFP = Call for Proposals**

**How conferences find speakers:**
- Open CFP 6-12 months before conference
- Speakers submit talk proposals
- Committee reviews and selects
- Speakers notified 2-4 months before conference

**Finding CFPs:**

**1. CFP tracking sites:**
- Sessionize.com (many conferences use this)
- Papercall.io
- Confreaks (conference talk archive + CFP listings)

**2. Twitter/X:**
- Follow #CFP hashtag
- Follow conference accounts
- Many announce CFPs on Twitter

**3. Conference websites:**
- Check past conferences you know (JavaOne, SpringOne, DevNexus)
- Look for "Call for Speakers" or "CFP" link

**Submitting strong proposal:**

**Components:**

1. **Title** (10 words max, specific and benefit-focused)

"Spring Boot + Redis Caching: 40x Performance Improvement in Production"

2. **Abstract** (200-300 words, what audience will learn)

[Same as meetup pitch, slightly expanded]

3. **Outline** (5-7 bullet points, talk structure)

- Introduction and background (2 min)
- Problem: slow analytics queries (3 min)
- Solution: Redis caching architecture (5 min)
- Implementation with code examples (10 min)
- Results and metrics (3 min)
- Trade-offs and when NOT to use caching (3 min)
- Q&A (5 min)

4. **Target audience** (who is this for?)

"Backend developers using Spring Boot who have performance challenges with database queries."

5. **Speaker bio** (100-150 words)

"Leo is a software engineer with a unique background: 4 years as a Navy petroleum systems technician and 5 years managing pipeline SCADA operations at Kinder Morgan. He now builds enterprise software with operational reliability patterns learned from critical infrastructure systems. His current project, Bibby, demonstrates modern Spring Boot architecture with real-time analytics and sub-50ms response times. Leo writes about backend architecture and career transitions at blog.yourname.com."

6. **Tags/topics**

Spring Boot, Java, Redis, Caching, Performance, Backend

**First-time speaker advantage:**

Many conferences have diversity goals, including "first-time speaker" diversity. Mention if it's your first conference talk—it can help.

**Acceptance rates:**

- **Regional conferences:** 20-40%
- **Major conferences:** 5-15%

**Don't be discouraged by rejections.** Submit to 5-10 CFPs. One will accept.

## Part 9: Measuring Success

**How to know if speaking is working.**

### Immediate Metrics (Day-Of)

- **Attendance:** 20-50 people at local meetup is great
- **Engagement:** Questions asked (3-5 good questions = engaged)
- **Conversations:** People approach after (5-10 = strong interest)
- **LinkedIn requests:** Get 5-15 same day/next day

**If these happen, talk was successful.**

### Medium-Term Metrics (1-4 Weeks)

- **Video views:** If recorded, 100-500 views in first month (meetup) or 500-2,000 (conference)
- **Slide views:** 200-500 SlideShare views
- **Blog traffic:** Spike in traffic to related blog post
- **Recruiter reach-outs:** 1-3 InMails from recruiters who saw talk or slides
- **Speaking invitations:** 1-2 invites to speak at other meetups

### Long-Term Metrics (3-6 Months)

- **Career opportunities:** Job interviews that mention your talk
- **Network growth:** 50-100 new LinkedIn connections from speaking
- **Authority building:** People reference your talk ("I saw your Redis caching talk...")
- **Repeat invitations:** Asked to speak at same meetup again, or referred to others

### Qualitative Signals

**You're a successful speaker when:**

1. **People quote you:** "As Leo said in his talk..."
2. **Organizers seek you out:** Invitations without you pitching
3. **You enjoy it:** First talk is terrifying, fifth is fun
4. **Content lives on:** Blog post/video/slides continue getting traffic months later

## Part 10: Common Speaking Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Much Content

**Wrong:** 60 slides for 25-minute talk

**Right:** 20-25 slides, one idea per slide

**Why:** Rushing through slides feels frantic. Better to cover less deeply than more superficially.

### Mistake 2: Reading Slides Verbatim

**Wrong:** Turning back to screen, reading bullet points word-for-word

**Right:** Slides have minimal text, you explain in your own words

**Why:** Audience can read. They came to hear YOU, not watch you read.

### Mistake 3: Live Coding Without Practice

**Wrong:** "Let me just write this code real quick..." [5 minutes of typing and debugging]

**Right:** Pre-written code, you walk through it. Or pre-recorded demo.

**Why:** Live coding goes wrong. Always. Unless you've practiced 10+ times.

### Mistake 4: No Backup Plan for Tech Failure

**Wrong:** Laptop crashes, you have no backup, talk is over

**Right:** Slides on USB drive, slides uploaded to Google Drive, slides on phone (emergency)

**Why:** Technology fails. Murphy's law of speaking.

### Mistake 5: Apologizing Excessively

**Wrong:** "Sorry, I'm really nervous. Sorry, this slide is messy. Sorry I'm not a great speaker."

**Right:** Don't apologize unless actual mistake (like showing wrong slide)

**Why:** Audience doesn't notice most mistakes. Apologizing draws attention to them.

### Mistake 6: Ignoring Time Limits

**Wrong:** 25-minute slot, you talk for 40 minutes, cut into next speaker

**Right:** Finish at 23-24 minutes, leave time for Q&A

**Why:** Going over time is disrespectful to organizers and audience.

### Mistake 7: Not Practicing

**Wrong:** "I know my topic, I'll wing it."

**Right:** Practice 5-10 times minimum

**Why:** Even Steve Jobs practiced. You're not better than Steve Jobs.

## Conclusion: Speaking as Brand Amplifier

Writing builds your brand slowly and steadily (Section 18). Speaking amplifies it dramatically.

**The math:**

- **Blog post:** Reaches 100-500 people over 6 months (SEO, shares)
- **Meetup talk:** Reaches 50 people in 1 hour, plus video views
- **Conference talk:** Reaches 200+ people in 1 hour, plus 1,000+ video views

**The network effect:**

After 5 talks (3 meetups, 2 conferences):
- 300-400 people have seen you speak
- 2,000-5,000 have watched videos
- 50-100 have had post-talk conversations with you
- 10-20 have become genuine connections

**You're no longer "just another junior developer."**

**You're "Leo, the former pipeline operator who speaks about operational reliability in software."**

That's differentiation. That's brand. That's career momentum.

**Week 21 success = First talk prepared, speaking slot secured (even if it's 4-8 weeks out).**

By giving your first talk, you've crossed a threshold most developers never cross. You're now a speaker. That's a credential that opens doors.

**The first talk is the hardest. Second is easier. Fifth is fun.**

Start climbing.
