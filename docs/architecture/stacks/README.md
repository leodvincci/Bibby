In library science, "stacks" (or "book stacks") means the shelving area where the collection is physically stored and arranged, usually by call number.​

What "stacks" refers to
The stacks are the rows of shelves that hold most of a library's circulating books and other physical items, as opposed to reading rooms or study spaces. When a catalog record says an item is "in the stacks," it means the item is on those shelves in the main collection area, not in reference, reserves, or special collections.​

Open vs. closed stacks
Many academic and public libraries use open stacks, where patrons can walk into the shelving area, browse the shelves, and retrieve books themselves. Some libraries or storage areas use closed stacks, where the shelves are in a non-public space and staff must retrieve items for users on request.​

Relation to call numbers and floors
Within the stacks, books are arranged by call number, which gives their exact position on the shelves. Libraries often spread the stacks across multiple floors or sections, assigning particular call number ranges to specific locations (for example, certain letters on one floor and others on another).​
