# Bibby Specification Documents

This directory contains micro-slice specifications that document systematic 
code quality improvements and refactorings in the Bibby codebase.

## Purpose

These specs serve as:
- Design documentation for changes
- Communication artifacts between development tools
- Historical record of architectural decisions
- Templates for future similar improvements

## Workflow

Each spec follows this lifecycle:
1. **Created** - Problem identified, spec written
2. **Implemented** - Code changes made following spec
3. **Merged** - Changes reviewed and integrated
4. **Status** - Marked complete in spec document
